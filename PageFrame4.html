        <h2>BasicBites - Program Execution</h2>
        <t-b>
          Execution of all user code happens in the context of a process.  Native code is embedded, by the compiler, in
          an execution image which is then loaded, at execution time, into a newly created process.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          Managed source code compiles to byte code.  At execution time a new process is created and loads a virtual machine.
          Byte code is &quot;just-in-time&quot; compiled by the virtual machine on a function or assembly basis and run in the
          context of the new process.  Compiled byte code is cached and not compiled again.

        <t-b>
          In Windows a process is a container of one or more threads and resources they share.  All process resources are
          accessed and manipulated using handles.  Figure 1. shows a process with handles for two threads, a dynamic link
          library, loaded at execution time, and handles to GUI windows and heap memory.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          Windows has an object model that provides programs with handles to object instances created with calls to the
          Windows API.  For example, a heap object is created with:
          <code>
            HANDLE HeapCreate(DWORD flOptions, SIZE_T dwInitialSize, SIZE_T dwMaximumSize);
          </code>
          Most of a program&apos;s API calls are handled by the programming lanaguage&apos;s standard libraries so the
          program doesn&apos;t need to know about these calls.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          The Windows scheduler starts, runs, and interrupts threads, not processes.  A Windows process is just a container
          for its threads and resources.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          The process model for linux and Unix are similar to Windows except that a linux thread is simply a child process
          that shares its parent&apos;s address space.  That is hidden by the pthread library and linux no longer increments its
          reported process count when a new thread is created.  So, the linux scheduler starts, runs, and interrupts processes.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          Process memory is divided into:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Static memory holding code and global data
            </li>
            <li>
              Stack memory is allocated when the program&apos;s thread of execution enters a new scope, delineated by &quot;{...}&quot;,
              and deallocated when execution leaves the scope.  For native code this scratch-pad memory holds function parameters
              and all local objects declared within the scope.  For managed code stack memory holds
              values for value types and references to heap-based objects for managed types.  This is true for both function parameters
              and instances declared within the current scope.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heap memory allocated with calls to <inline-code>new</inline-code>.  Native code deallocates heap-based instances with
              calls to <inline-code>delete</inline-code>.  Managed code uses the services of a garbage collector to defer deallocation
              for latter analysis to ensure that no references to the instance remain.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          All code, both native and managed run in some scope.  The semantics of construction and assignment are
          quite different for native and managed types.  Native types are by default copy constructed and copy assigned.
          If a native instance holds a
          reference to an object on the heap, its copy constructor and copy assignment operator are obligated to make copies of
          both parts, the stack part and its heap resource, as shown in Figure 2.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          This creats a new independent instance that holds the same state as the original, but may be seperately
          mutated without affecting the original.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          Managed code semantics for construction and assignment are shown in Figure 2.  Value types are copied just like
          native types, but
          for reference types only the handles are copied, so both wind up pointing to the same instance.  Future mutations
          of either one affect the other as well, because the two handles always point to the same underlying instance.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          The point of this is to see that different languages may use platform resources in quite different ways, each
          with their own advantages and disadvantages.  We will explore this in more detail in
          <a href="BasicBites_ProgTypes.html">Types</a> and <a href="BasicBites_ObjModel.html">Object Models</a>.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          For this discussion we&apos;ve taken C++ semantics as the prototypical
          native type and C# as the prototypical managed type.  We will see in Types that the Rust programming language
          semantics are an interesting variant that combines some of the strongest features of each.

        <h4>Native Types</h4>
        <div class="indent">
          <t-b>
            Native programs compile to platform instructions running in the process created for their executable.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            C++ and Rust both compile to native code.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            Native data types are:
            <ul class="tight" style="margin-left:0rem;">
              <li>
                types with contiguous memory footprints:
                <div class="indent">
                  primitive types, native arrays, and structs without pointer or reference members
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                types with non-contiguous memory footprints:
                <div class="indent">
                  most library and user-defined types, like String.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                pointers and references to either of the above
              </li>
            </ul>
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            These types reside in the stack frame where they are declared.  Each type may compose instances of
            other native types and aggregations of native instances on the native heap, as shown in Figure 1.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            Compositions of native types place the composed instances within the memory footprint of the composing
            instance.  Aggregations place handles to the aggregated instance in the memory footprint of the
            aggregator and places the instances themselves in the native heap.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            Native types provide code that returns owned resources to the platform when they go out of scope.
            this is an efficient deterministic destruction process.

        <h4>Managed Types</h4>
        <div class="indent">
          <t-b>
            Managed programs compile to byte code and run in a virtual machine (VM) hosted by the process created for them.
            At load time the VM compiles byte code to native code by function or assembly. The compiled code is cached and
            not compiled again.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            C# and Java are managed languages - there are many others based on the Java VM.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            Managed code has three kinds of data types: value types, managed reference types, and managed handles:
            <ul class="tight" style="margin-left:0rem;">
              <li>
                Value types
                <div class="indent">
                  primitives, native arrays, and structs<br />
                  implement Copy type behavior described in Part 1
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                Managed reference types
                <div class="indent">
                  all user-defined types<br />
                  implement Reference type behavior of Part 1.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                Managed handles (references)
                <div class="indent">
                  support access and resource management
                </div>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            All managed reference types reside in the managed heap.  They may compose instances of value types.
            Those reside in the composer&apos;s memory footprint.  They may also aggregate instances of reference types.
            That results in the instance holding a composed handle to an aggregated instance in the managed heap.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            The resources of managed reference types are not managed by the instance; instead are managed by a
            garbage collector that is part of the heap&apos;s management process.  When a managed reference instance
            goes out of scope its resources are queued for disposal by the garbage collector.  That is a
            non-determinstic, tiered process that requires platform processing to track active references.
          </t-b>
          <a id="res"></a>
        </div>
        <h4>Resource Management:</h4>
        <div class="indent">
          <t-b>
            Native code handles resource management in an elegant efficient way, often referred to as &quot;Resource
            Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII).  Use of native pointers and references open opportunities for
            undefined behavior.  The Rust language has an interesting way to avoid this deficit, as discussed in
            <a href="BasicBites_ProgTypes.html">Program Types</a>.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            Managed code requires placement of all user-defined types on the managed heap, accessed through handles.
            This avoids problems with undefined behavior at the expense of processing required to manage instances
            and latencies associated with compiling byte code to native code at run time.

                All C# and Java user-defined types are Move types but neither language enforces single ownership.
                That doesn&apos;t cause undefined behavior because these move types are handles to a single instance
                on the heap, but it may cause difficulty in managing program operations.

          C++ is the classic native language.  Java and C# (very similar languages) are archtypes of managed languages.
          Rust generates native code, but has some of the look-and-feel of managed code, in part due to its Copy and
          Move Type dichotomy.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          All four languages enable building the same kinds of program functionality.  But the implementation techniques
          are occasionally different.  My personal opinion is that Rust source code more accurately represents its
          underlying mechanics than the other three.  For example, both Rust and C++ have syntax for Move operations,
          but Rust enforces no use after move at compile time, while C++ will allow subsequent use with likely
          undefined behavior.
