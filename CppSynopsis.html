          <indent-block class="pad10">
            C++ derives most of its language elements and function structure from the C programming language, which in turn, inherited those things from Algol, a European language. It derives its notions of class from SmallTalk.

          <summary>Classes</summary>
          <indent-block class="pad10">
            A class is a language construct that binds together member functions and data, providing access
            to users only to public member functions, not to its data. This encapsulation enables the class
            to make strong guarantees about validity of its data.
            <spacer-10></spacer-10>
            This class was designed to hold file information, including both file name and path.  The intent
            is to hold any given file name only once, even if the file has copies in several directories, and
            to hold each path name only once.  That is done using a unique arrangement of STL containers.

          <summary>Value Types</summary>
          <indent-block class="pad10">
            A value type provides copying, assignment, and move operations that allow instances of the
            type to behave like built-in types.

          <summary>Functors</summary>
          <indent-block class="pad10">
            A functor is a class that defines operator(). That means that instances can be "invoked" like this:
            <pre>
  class AFunctor {
  public:
    AFunctor(const X& x) : x_(x) {}
    void operator()(const Y& y) { /* do something useful to x_, using y */ }
    X value() { return x_; }
  private:
    X x_;
  };

  AFunctor func;
  Y y;
  func(y);          // syntactically looks like a function call
  func.operator(y); // equivalent to the statement above
            </pre>

            Functors are used in CallableObjects code demo in <a href="CppBasicDemos.html">CppBasicDemos</a>
            repository.

        <details>
          <summary>Lambdas</summary>
          <indent-block class="pad10">
            A lambda is an anonymous callable object that can be passed to, and returned from other
            functions. A lambda is really a short-cut to define a functor.
            A very useful feature of lambdas is their capture semantics. They can store data defined
            in their local scope, to be used later when they are invoked.

            <pre>
  std::function makeLambda(const std::string& msg)
  {
    // [=] implies capture by value, [&] implies capture by reference
  
    std::function<void()> fun = [=]()
    {
      std::cout << "\n  displaying captured data: " << msg;
    };
    return fun;
  }

  // in some other scope

  std::function myFun = makeLambda("hello CSE687-OnLine");
  std::cout << "\n  using Lambda: " << myFun() << "\n";
              </pre>

          <summary>Callable Objects</summary>
          <indent-block class="pad10">
            A callable object is any C++ construct that can be invoked using parentheses, callable(...). Function pointers, functors, and lambdas are all callable objects. Here's a function that accepts and invokes any callable object that takes no arguments:
            <pre>
  template&lt;typename T&gt;
  void invoker(T&amp; callable)  // callable could be a lamda with captured data
  {
    callable();  // use captured data instead of function arguments
  }
            </pre>

          <summary>Class Relationships</summary>
          <indent-block class="pad10">
            Classes have four <a href="DesignNote-CppClassRelationships.html">relationships</a>:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Inheritance:<br />
                A derived class inherits all it's base's members. Non-virtual base functions should not
                be redefined in the derived class. Virtual member functions may be redefined in the derived
                class. Pure virtual functions must be redefined.
              </li>
              <li>
                Composition:<br />
                Instances declared as class data members are composed by the class, creating a strong
                owning relationship. Composed members are always constructed when the composer is
                constructed, and destroyed when the composer is destroyed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Aggregation:<br />
                A class aggregates a data member when it holds a pointer to the member instance on
                the native heap. Creation of an instance of some type as local data in a member function
                is also considered to be aggregation. Aggregated instances are owned by the aggregator,
                but this is a weaker relationship than composition, as the aggregated instances do not
                exist until code in the aggregator creates them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using:<br />
                A class uses an instance of some other class when it is passed the instance to one of
                its public member funtions by reference. Using is a non-owning relationship and your
                classes should respect the owning code by doing nothing to invalidate the used instance.
                Passing an instance by value to a member function is really aggregation, because the
                receiving class creates and uses its own copy.
              </li>
            </ul>
            These four relationships are all that are needed to build Object Oriented programs.

          <summary>Compound Objects</summary>
          <indent-block class="pad10">
            Compound objects are instances of classes that use inheritance, composition, and aggregation
            of other classes to carry out their mission. We need to be careful, especially with
            initialization, to ensure they operate as expected. Here is a good example of the initialization
            and use of compound objects.

          <summary>Templates</summary>
          <indent-block class="pad10">
            Templates are compile time constructs that allow us to avoid writing a lot of nearly identical
            code for classes that could sensibly use any of several concrete types, perhaps as arguments
            to member functions or as instances of member data. Containers are a good example.
            <spacer-10></spacer-10>
            Here is an example from <a href="CppBlockingQueue.html">CppBlockingQueue</a> repository.
            <div class='code'>
              <pre>
template &lt;typename T&gt;
class BlockingQueue {
public:
  BlockingQueue() {}
  BlockingQueue(BlockingQueue&lt;T&gt;&& bq);
  BlockingQueue&lt;T&gt;& operator=(BlockingQueue&lt;T&gt;&& bq);
  BlockingQueue(const BlockingQueue&lt;T&gt;&) = delete;
  BlockingQueue&lt;T&gt;& operator=(const BlockingQueue&lt;T&gt;&) = delete;
  T deQ();
  void enQ(const T& t);
  T& front();
  void clear();
  size_t size();
private:
  std::queue&lt;T&gt; q_;
  std::mutex mtx_;
  std::condition_variable cv_;
};
              </pre>
            </div>
            T is a type that isn&apos;t specified until an application using the queue is compiled, so
            it will hold strings or messages or whatever the application needs without changing any of
            the BlockingQueue code.
            <spacer-10></spacer-10>
            Templates are also useful for building functions that accept callable objects, i.e., function
            pointers, functors, or lambdas. We use template functions to accept instances of any of these
            distinct types. Thread constructors are a good example.

            Here are a few interesting examples of template use:

          <summary>Exceptions</summary>
          <indent-block class="pad10">
            Exceptions are a language defined mechanism for handling errors. Exception handling uses
            instances of std::exception and the key words throw, try, and catch. You should always
            throw exceptions by value and catch them by reference.

          <summary>Namespaces</summary>
          <indent-block class="pad10">
            A namespace defines a compile-time scope used to distinguish between two or more type or
            function names with the same value but that have distinct definitions in separate places
            in code for a single compilation unit. A namespace extends the name of a type, for example,
            by prepending the type name with the namespace name, i.e., MyNamespace::MyType.

          <summary>Dark Corners</summary>
          <indent-block class="pad10">
            The C++ language has a surprisingly short list of dark corners, e.g., compilable constructs
            that may cause subtle errors. Most of these have to do with causing Liskov Substitution to fail
            by improper overloading, overriding, or failing to provide virtual destructors.

      <summary>Standard Libraries</summary>
      <indent-block class="pad10">
        The C++ language uses a very well engineered set of standard libraries for I/O, managing data,
        and using threads, and much more. Each new C++ standard introduces new libraries or new library
        features. We've focused on these:

          <indent-block class="pad10">
            A collection of libraries for stream-based I/O, for the console, files, and in-memory strings.
            Streams use the insertion operator&lt;&lt;(...) and extraction operator&gt;&gt;(...) to build
            composable input and output operations. Here is code and a brief presentation about the structure of
            the <a href="IOStreams.html">streams library</a>.

            The Standard Template Library is a subset of the C++ standard libraries.
            It provides a large set of containers, each with a defined iterator type,
            and a set of algorithms designed to operate on the containers.
            All of the containers are endowed with correct construction, copy, and destruction semantics.

            locks of various kinds, atomics, condition variables, and futures.
            <spacer-10></spacer-10>
            Futures are interesting because they support returning values computed by child threads,
            blocking until the result is ready.
            Here are some useful code demos and resources for programs that use threads:

        They supplement the C++ Standard Libraries, providing functionality that does not exist
        there (as of C++11).

      <summary>Threads</summary>
      <indent-block class="pad10">
        A thread is a block of processing instructions, defined by a function passed to the operating system (OS),
        that executes in a processor core, and is started and stopped by the OS. A thread often runs in an
        environment containing many other threads that are sequenced in short time-slices by the OS to behave
        like concurrent processing.
        <spacer-10></spacer-10>
        A thread may run continuously in a core if there are no other threads contending for that resource.
        The C++ Standard Library provides the libraries: thread and atomic to support concurrency.

      <summary>Sockets</summary>
      <indent-block class="pad10">
        An interface for network communication provided by a low-level Windows library. The sockets we discuss
        are all stream-oriented, reading and writing sequences of bytes. Stream-oriented means that
        sockets do not provide you with a message structure. If you need that you will have to provide it.
        <spacer-10></spacer-10>
        In order to communicate these sockets have to be connected. To connect, your code needs,
        on one end of the channel, a connecter socket and, on the other end, a socket listener,
        to listen for, and establish a connected channel.
        <spacer-10></spacer-10>
        The Sockets library, in these repositories, provides good support for building programs using
        network communication.

      <summary>Graphical User Interfaces</summary>
      <indent-block class="pad10">
        The standard C++ libraries do not provide any support for Graphical User Interfaces.
        But it is fairly easy to provide one for a native C++ application by using a C#-based Windows
        Presentation Foundation (WPF) project that communicates with the application through a
        C++\CLI shim. The WPF-Interop demo is a simple example of how to do this.
