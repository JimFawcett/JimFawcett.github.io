    <div class="indent">
      <p>
        The C++ language was built from the ground up to support user defined value types.  It does that with copy constructors and copy
        assignment operators that allow the designer to implement deep copies.  That makes the state of the destination object have the
        same value as the state of the source, but those states are independent.  If the source changes its state later, that does not
        affect the state of the destination.
      </p>
      <p>
        C++ provides destructors that are called when the thread of execution leaves the scope where the instance was declared.  This means
        the developers have tight control over how and when an instance's resources are returned to the process, for use by other instances.
        More importantly, the users of C++ classes do not need to be aware of these resource allocations and deallocations.  They simply
        use instances of the classes and the instances take care of all resource management.
      </p>
      <p>
        The language also provides move construction and move assignment operations.  Move construction builds an instance, taking ownership
        of another instance's state.  This transfer is very efficient, usually effected with a pointer swap.  Similarly, move assignment
        discards the destination's state and it takes ownership of the source's state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Move operations usually only occur when the source is a temporary object, but the compiler can be coerced to execute a move on
        a non-temporary object by using the std::move(...) operation.  Note that you need to be careful with this, as the source no longer
        owns it's former state and may be unable to continue.  Essentially, the use of the std::move(...) is a promise not to use the
        source object any longer, or to reinitialize it in some effective way.
      </p>

      There are four <a href="../Presentations/ClassRelationships.pdf">class relationships</a>,
      <a href="Repository/Presentations/ClassRelationships.doc">doc</a>,
      we use to construct Object Oriented Designs: Inheritance, Composition, Aggregation,
      and Using.  Inheritance is an "is-a" relationship.  Composition is a strong ownership or "part-of" relationship.  Aggregation
      is also a "part-of" relationship, but is weaker than composition because it does not guarantee that the aggregated part is
      owned, only that it can be owned by the aggregator.  Finally, using is a dependency on an object that is not part of the user,
      was not created by the user, and should not be destroyed by the user.

      <h4 style="padding-bottom:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">Construction Behaviors:</h4>
      <ol style="margin-top:5px; margin-left:0px;">
        <li>An instance of C is always contained within the footprint of each instance of B.</li>
        <li>Clients of B do not see C's public interface.  That is only accessible to B.</li>
        <li>Similarly, an instance of B is always contained within each instance of D.</li>
        <li>Since D derives from B via public inheritance, its public methods become public methods of D.</li>
        <li>
          The C++ language guarantees that a constructor call is made for the creation of every object
          even if the class designer did not provide constructors.  It does that by generating default and copy constructors
          that do member-wise construction of the class's bases and data elements if the class definition does not explicitly
          provide them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Similarly, the language guarantees that a destructor call is made for every object as it leaves the scope
          in which it was declared, even if the class designer did not provide a destructor.  In that case the compiler
          generates a destructor that does member-wise destruction of each of the class's bases and member data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Note:
          <span class="itemcallout top">
            This means that you must always decide whether to provide default and copy constructors and destructors for
            every class you design.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            If a class's bases and member data have correct copy, assignment, and destruction semantics, then you
            don't need to, and should not, provide them.  That is always true if your class holds only primitive types
            and containers from the Standard Template Library, or holds instances of classes for which that is true.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          If your class holds pointers to data on the heap, then you must provide copy, assignment, and destruction
          operations, or qualify those operations with delete.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you class holds any types that do not support copying or assignment, like mutexes and critical sections,
          then you must qualify copy, assignment, and destruction operations with delete.
        </li>
      </ol>

          This code has classes C, B, D, and U, shown in the diagram above.  All of these classes,
          in the demo code, have correct

          those operations, deferring to the compiler generated ones.
