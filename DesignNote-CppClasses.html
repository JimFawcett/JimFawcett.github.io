        It does that with copy constructors and copy
        assignment operators that allow the designer to implement deep copies.  That makes the state of the destination object have the
        same value as the state of the source, but those states are independent.  If the source changes its state later, that does not
        affect the state of the destination.

      <p>
        C++ provides destructors that are called when the thread of execution leaves the scope where the instance was declared.  This means
        that developers have tight control over how and when an instance's resources are returned to the process, for use by other instances.
        Users of C++ classes do not need to be aware of these resource allocations and deallocations.  They simply
        use instances of the classes and the instances take care of all resource management.
      </p>
      <p>
        The language also provides move construction and move assignment operations.  Move construction builds an instance, taking ownership
        of another instance's state.  This transfer is very efficient, usually effected with a pointer swap.  Similarly, move assignment
        discards the destination's state and it takes ownership of the source's state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Move operations usually occur only when the source is a temporary object, but the compiler can be coerced to execute a move on
        a non-temporary object by using the std::move(...) operation.  Note that you need to be careful with this, as the source no longer
        owns it's former state and may be unable to continue.  Essentially, the use of the std::move(...) is a promise not to use the
        source object any longer, or to reinitialize it in some effective way.
      </p>
      <h3>Construction-Destruction Guarantee:</h3>
      <p>
        Instances of C++ classes hold instances of their base classes and composed member data in their
        <a href="../presentations/ClassesAndObjects.pdf">memory footprint</a>.  That means that a class's bases and composed members
        are an integral part of the class, and are always constructed when a class instance is constructed, and destroyed when it is
        destroyed.  C++ Guarantees that!  There is no way to prevent it.
        <div style="height:0px;"></div>
        For this reason, the language has to ensure that is always possible. It does so by providing compiler generated operations.
      </p>
      <h3>Compiler Generated Operations:</h3>
      <p>
        C++ Compilers will generate construction and destruction operations if not provided by the class.
        <ul>
          <li>
            If no constructors are declared for the class, the compiler will generate a default constructor that does default construction
            on each of its base classes<sup>1</sup>, if any, and member wise default construction on each member.
          </li>
          <li>
            The compiler will always generate a copy constructor if not declared by the class. The compiler generated copy constructor
            copies into the class instances of each base class of the source instance, and copies of each member of the source into its members.
          </li>
          <li>
            If not declared by the class, the compiler will always generate a copy assignment operator which does member-wise assignment
            from the source instance's base classes and member data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the class does not declare a destructor, the compiler will always generate a destructor that does member-wise destruction
            of each of the class's base instances and members.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="notecallout">
          For every class you define, you should decide whether to provide construction, assignment, and destruction operations, or
          allow the compiler to generate them, or to disable those operations.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For every class with bases and members all of which have correct copy, assignment, and destruction semantics, you
            don't need to, and should not, provide those operations.  Primitive data and STL containers all have correct
            semantics for those operations, and classes that have only primitive and STL container data, have correct semantics
            for those operations.
            <div style="height:15px;"></div>
            For almost every other class, the compiler generated operations will not be correct, and you must either provide them
            or disable them.  Classes that contain pointers are examples of where you need to do this.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can disable operations by declaring the operation followed by =delete.  Here's an example:
            <pre>
  Y(const Y&amp; y) = delete;
            </pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <a name="ruleOfThree" />
      <h3>The Rule of Threes:</h3>
      <p>
        To summarize, for the three operations of construction, assignment, and destruction, we have three choices:
        <ul class="tightlist">
          <li>
            Allow the compiler to generate them - don't declare them - if all the classes bases and members have
            correct construction, assignment, and destruction semantics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide them by declaring and implementing each of the operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disable them by declaring each of the operations using = delete at the end of the declaration.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
