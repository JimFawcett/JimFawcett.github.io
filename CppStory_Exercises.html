    <span style="font-size:large;">Programming exercises: C++ Basic Syntax:</span>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Write a function that accepts a std::string by const reference, efficiently reverses the string&apos;s
          character sequence, and returns the reversed string by value.
          <hr />
          Requires copy construction of temp std::string, looping half way through the string, and swapping characters
          between the first half and the second half.  What happens if the string has an odd number of characters?
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat the first exercise, but replace the std::string with a std::vector&lt;char&gt;.
          <hr />
          Very similar to the first exercise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat the first exercise, but replace the std::string with a std::list&lt;char&gt;.
          <hr />
          More complex than the first exercise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write code that declares two floating point numbers and initializes one to a know value.
          Write a function that, using pointers, copies each byte of the intialized number into
          the other.  Verify that after the copy both numbers hold the same value. Write another
          function that compares the two numbers, byte by byte, using pointers.
          <hr />
          You will want to ensure that no buffer overruns occur, by using the sizeof operator.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write a function that accepts an integer value and returns a std::list of the last N values
          entered, where N is a second function parameter.
          <hr />
          That will require you to use a static std::list in the function.
          Look at <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">cppreference.com</a> for information about
          std::list.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write a function that accepts std::vector&lt;double&gt; and displays its elements, where each element
          is separated by a comma.
          <hr />
          There should be no comma at the end.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat the last exercise, but write each element in a fixed width field, where the field size
          is a second parameter of the function. If the width is too small to hold the largest of the double elements, increase the size of the
          field.
          <hr />
          That will require you to step through the collection and convert each element to a std::string
          representation (look up std::to_string), and find the largest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write a lambda that accepts a std::string message and displays it on the console with a second
          line composed of &apos;-&apos; characters.
          <hr />
          If the lambda prepends the message with a newline, indents it two spaces, and makes the underline
          string two characters longer, with a one character indent, the result creates a nice title.
          Can you create the lambda so it also accepts an underline character which defaults to &apos;-&apos;?
        </li>
        <li>
          Write a class that has a single implemented method,
          <code-span>void title(const std::string&amp; msg)</code-span>.
          The method should format the title, as in Exercises-1:7.
          <hr />
          How many methods does this class have? Remember that the compiler will generate certain
          constructors, a copy assignment operator, and a destructor.  The answer depends on whether
          you stored the msg string as a member of the class - no need to do that for a title, but
          you might want to add other functionality to the class later.
          Should you implement the compiler generated methods?
        </li>
        <li>
          For the class you created in the first exercise, add a method called
          <code-span>add(const std::string&amp; text)</code-span> that
          accepts a std::string and appends it to a private std::string member.  Also, add a method
          to return the std::string member by value.
          <hr />
          How should you initialize the std::string member?  Can you write the &quot;add&quot; method
          so that it returns a reference an invoking instance of the class?  That will allow you to
          chain calls, e.g., <code-span>x.add(":&nbsp;one").add(",&nbsp;two")</code-span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Build a class with method <code-span>bool top(const std::string&amp; fileSpec, size_t n)</code-span>.
          Attempt to open the file, and if that succeeds, display the first N lines.
          <hr />
          Please handle file opening errors in some meaningful way.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write code for a <code-span>WidgetUser</code-span> class that holds a <code-span>Widget* ptr</code-span>
          to a <code-span>Widget</code-span> instance on the native heap. Please provide void, copy construction,
          move construction, copy assignment, move assignment, and destructor methods for this class.
          <hr />
          You may assume that <code-span>Widget</code-span> instances have correct copy, move, and destruction
          semantics.  You don&apos;t need to provide any specific functionality for Widgets.  Consider using
          annunciating constructors to show that WidgeUser is properly managing its Widget.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write code for a class that composes a fundamental type and an STL container (if doesn&apos;t really matter which).
          Show, by careful testing, that the class can correctly allow the compiler to generate its default and copy
          constructors, assignment operator, and destructor. Now replace the composition with aggregation where the fundamental
          and STL container types are referenced by pointers to the native heap. Show that incorrect operations occur
          if you don&apos;t provide the copy, assignment, and destruction operations.  Now add those operations and
          show that class operations are valid again.  Finally, prevent the compiler from generating those methods
          using =delete. Note that you will have to provide a destructor (why is that?).
          <hr />
          Doing this exercise carefully is the best way I know of for you to learn how to handle compiler generated
          methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write all the code for a program that counts the number of directories rooted at
          some specified path.  That will require you to use an executive package and packages
          DirExplorerN and FileSystem.
          <hr />
          DirExplorerN is one of the projects in the <a href="../../FileManager.html">FileManager Repository</a>,
          and FileSystem is in the <a href="../../FileSystem.html">FileSystem</a> Repository.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat the first exercise, but now evaluate the size of the root path, e.g., the size of all
          files that belong to any of the directories on the specified path.
          <hr />
          Don&apos;t forget to include the sizes of all the files in the root directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using code from the <a href="https://github.com/JimFawcett/FileDates">FileDates</a> repository,
          build a class that finds all the files within a specified range of dates.
          <hr />
          What you are asked to do is fairly easy to implement, so take the time to look carefully
          at the design of the FileDates compound object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Modify code in the <a href="TextFinder.html">TextFinder</a> repository so you display N lines
          of code surrounding the matched text.
          <hr />
          This will require you to cache the last N/2 lines of code while searching, and look ahead
          N/2 lines when you find a match. A ciruclar buffer is one way to implement that caching.  See
          Exercise 4:1 for an exercise to build a template circular buffer.  You won&apos;t need
          templates for this buffer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Build an application, using the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">curl library</a> and
          <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">github API</a> to list all the repositories
          provided by <a href="https://github.com/JimFawcett">github.com/JimFawcett</a>
          <hr />
          This exercise is significantly larger than most of the other exercises in this C++ story.

        </li>
        <li>
          Write a calculator class that provides methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication
          and division.  Use template parameters to support those operations for all the C++
          arithmetic types.
          <hr />
          Can you make this work for complex numbers? You will need a specialization
          for that. what will you do for division?
        </li>
        <li>
          Write a CircularBuffer class that has an &quot;add&quot; method that accepts
          a value of unspecified type and appends it to a private member collection -
          one of the STL containers.  After the method has been called N times, it
          appends the new item and discards the oldest item, keeping the collection
          size at N items. Provide an iterator that starts at the most recent and
          increments toward the oldest.
          <hr />
          Is there an STL container that will make this very easy to implement?
          Please demonstrate that your CircularBuffer instances behave as expected.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write a numeric formatter that returns the string representation of any
          of the numeric types, in a field with of N characters. so, the string
          representation for the floating point number 3.5 in a field of 6 might
          appear as either &quot;3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; or as
          &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5&quot;.
          <hr />
          Extend the formatter to work with strings, where, if the string is longer
          than the field width, you trucate to the first N characters, then replace
          the last three characters in the truncated string with "...", so my name
          in a field of 8 would appear as &quot;Jim F...&quot;.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write a set of template function overloads:
          <code-span style="display:block; font-size:large;">
<pre>
  template &lt;typename T&gt;
  void WhoAmI(const T&amp; t)
  {
    ...
  }
</pre>
          </code-span>
          that write a message to the console stating that t is one of:
          <ul class="tight pad10">
            <li>fundamental type</li>
            <li>STL sequentioal container</li>
            <li>STL associative container</li>
          </ul>
          <hr />
          The <a href="../../CppProperties.html">CppProperty</a> repository has code that does this
          kind of function overload - look for the functions at the end of Property.h. That
          code depends on the contents of CustomContTypeTraits.h in that repository.
        </li>
