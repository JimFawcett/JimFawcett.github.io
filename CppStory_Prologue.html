    <h3>Prologue:</h3>
    <indent-block>
      C++ is a widely used, and in some ways elegant, programming language.
      Its use is compelling because:
      <ul class="tight pad10">
        <li>
          It has excellent performance, due in part to the fact that it compiles to native machine code
          rather than to byte code interpreted by a virtual machine.
        </li>
        <li>
          C++ is very expressive.  Its operator syntax, use of aliases, and syntactic separation of
          interface from implementation, allows a designer to express design intents very clearly.
        </li>
        <li>
          The language supports class designs that allow users to be oblivious of the acquisition
          and handling of resources.  Its standard libraries often make a lot of that almost automatic.
        </li>
        <li>
          It provides direct control over the acquisition and release of resources, and those
          actions are deterministic.  The designer has a lot of control over the release of resources
          that are shared within a process, like file handles.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is the only modern language that supports creating user-defined value behavior with
          classes that may also participate in polymorphic class hierarchies.
        </li>
        <li>
          C++ is still evolving to become more efficient, designer-friendly, and provide more artifacts that
          support safe, reliable operation, like the standard smart pointers, move operations, and better
          type deduction.  Its current standard is C++17 and the next, C++20, is moving toward completion.
        </li>
      </ul>
      This story is intended to help you get started or refresh your knowledge of C++.
