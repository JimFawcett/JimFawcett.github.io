    <h3>Prologue:</h3>
      <t-b>
        The <span class="notice">C++ programming language</span> is a widely used, and in some ways elegant, programming language.
        Its use is compelling because:
      </t-b>
      <t-b class="indent">
        <ul class="tight">
          <li>
            It has excellent performance, due in part to the fact that it compiles to native machine code
            rather than to bytecode interpreted by a virtual machine.
          </li>
          <li>
            C++ is very expressive.  Its operator syntax, use of aliases, and syntactic separation of
            interface from implementation, allow a designer to express design intents very clearly.
          </li>
          <li>
            The language supports class designs that allow users to be oblivious of the acquisition
            and handling of resources.  Its standard libraries often make a lot of that almost automatic.
          </li>
          <li>
            It provides direct control over the acquisition and release of resources, and those
            actions are deterministic.  The designer has a lot of control over the release of resources
            that are shared within a process, like file handles.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is the only modern language that supports creating user-defined <span class="notice">value</span> behavior with
            classes that may also participate in polymorphic class hierarchies.  Value types are copyable and
            assignable.  Many C++ classes are value types by default.  For those that are not, the language provides
            constructs to support that behavior, e.g., copy constructors and overloadable assignment operators.
          </li>
          <li>
            C++ is still evolving to become more efficient, designer-friendly, and provide more artifacts that
            support safe, reliable operation, like the standard smart pointers, move operations, and better
            type deduction.  Its current standard is C++17 and the next, C++20, is moving toward completion.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        This story is intended to help you get started or refresh your knowledge of C++.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Most <span class="notice">other languages</span>, like C# and Java, compile to bytecode that
        runs in a virtual machine - CLR for C# and JVM for Java. There are both benefits and deficits
        of using virtual machines:
      </t-b>
      <t-b class="indent">
        <ul class="tight">
          <li>
            Virtual machines provide services that are available for all programs that run in
            that environment.
            <i-b>
              <ul class="tight">
                <li>Reflection</li>
                <li>Exception handling</li>
                <li>Garbage Collection</li>
                <li>Interoperation with platform services</li>
              </ul>
            </i-b>          </li>
          <li>
            When multiple languages use the same virtual machine, interoperation between them
            becomes significantly simpler,  because they use the same platform abstraction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Performance is slower because bytecode runs in a stack-based platform abstraction layer
            and because garbage collection requires background processing to track references
            and destroy instances that are no longer targets for program references.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="notice">All</span> instances of classes are reference types meaning
            they are stored in the managed heap
            and have non-deterministic life times.  When types share system resources like
            files and database connections, it is important to release the resources as quickly as possible
            so they are available for other code.  Garbage collection can make timely release
            uncertain<sup>1</sup>. Classes that implement IDispose support the Dispose method
            which does provide a deterministic release of resources, but unfortunately every user
            of a Disposable type has to remember to call dispose().
          </li>
          <li>
            Reference types are not inherently copyable<sup>2</sup>. That means that the designer
            may have to provide a clone function that creates an instance of the type to be cloned
            and then copies source elements into the new instance.  That only works if the elements
            are value types or clonable objects like strings.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        My preferred language is C++, but frequently use other languages, especially C#,
        when working on a project that needs services provided by those languages.
        When building graphical user interfaces or communication processing I often
        use C# to get access to Windows Presentaton Foundation (WPF) and Windows Communication
        Foundation (WCF).
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Now that .Net Core is available, WPF can be used on
        non-Windows platforms as well.  WCF is not available other than on Windows, but there is a
        <a href="https://github.com/jacqueskang/IpcServiceFramework">third party framework</a>
        available for hosting IPC services on the platforms supported by .Net Core, e.g., Windows,
        Linux, and MacOS.

          <li>
            Garbage collection works surprisingly well most of the time, but most implementations
            are tiered. C# garbage collection for instances in the second tier runs once for
            every ten times the first tier is collected.  The third tier collection runs once for every
            ten times the second tier is collected.  Large instances and instances with long
            lifetimes are likely to migrate to higher tiers and take significantly longer to
            release their resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            The default performance of Object.MemberwiseClone() does not clone.  It simpy copies
            the instance handle, meaning that there is only one underlying instance with an
            additional reference.  In  order to make a genuine clone the designer has to 
            override MemberwiseClone() and provide the cloning semantics described above.
