    <h3>Concept:</h3>
    <indent-block>
      A story is a linked sequence of resources, mostly HTML pages, all focused on a common theme.
      You will find, in the documentation site, links to a <a href="StoryTeller.html">StoryTeller</a>
      that has, at this time, two stories:
      <ul class="tight pad10">
        <li>Test Story</li>
        <li>C++ Story</li>
      </ul>
      When the StoryTeller is opened, a list of available stories is presented for selection.
      A user may then navigate through the story using links or key presses.
    </indent-block>
    <h3>Design:<span style="font-size:0.75em;"> - Note: see status below</span></h3>
    <indent-block>
      StoryTeller provides an iframe that fills most of the available browser view, and a set of
      navigation buttons that invoke JavaScript functions for navigation and query.
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      For security reasons, iframes are not allowed to directly interact with host code.  However, the host
      needs to figure out how to link story pages.  The way that is done is:
      <ul class="tight pad10">
        <li>
          The StoryTeller host page loads a list of available stories.  When a user clicks on a link to
          one of the stories, a story Table of Contents page is loaded.  As part of the loading, that page
          analyzes its own links and text immediately below a link, and writes that information into localStorage.
        </li>
        <li>
          The StoryTeller host reads localStorage to extract all the story information so it can build
          a timeline - an array of JavaScript objects, each having a url, name, and page-notes.
          <spacer-10></spacer-10>
          It also builds a Table of Contents for the story, as a dropdown list, and provides buttons for
          manually steping through story content.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      It took quite a bit of JavaScript and CSS styling, and some fairly intricate event processing
      to get all this to work, but it does!
    </indent-block>
    <h3>Build:</h3>
    <indent-block>
      StoryTeller was built with Visual Studio Community Edition - 2019, and tested on Windows 10.
    </indent-block>
    <h3>Status:</h3>
    <indent-block>
      <h4>Update:</h4>
      The design of StoryTeller is still evolving.  I&apos;ve refactored its JavaScript, and eliminated
      localStorage eventing, as firefox does not provide change notification for file:// protocol, and
      Edge does not implement localStorage for that protocol.  The current version, StoryTeller_LocalStorage,
      uses iframe onLoad event exclusively. This version works well for the big three: FireFox, Chrome, and
      Edge when using https:// or http:// protocol.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      I&apos;m working on a version, StoryTeller_Messages, that uses JavaScript messages to 
      use with the file:// protocol.  That should work for all three major browsers.  
      That work has just started, been put on hold for other things, 
      but will make an appearance soon.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      The current contents of this repository is as indicated below, and won&apos;t be updated until
      StoryTeller_Messages is finished.
    </indent-block>
    <indent-block>
      <h4>Current Status of this repository:</h4>
      StoryTeller_LocalStorage.html is the current version hosted by this site.  It can 
      present any story that has a Story TOC page, as described above.
      Here&apos;s an <a href="CppStoryViewable.html">Example</a>.  Look at the page source to get an idea of
      how things work.   You can run it locally with FireFox, but not with Chrome (since I changed the event processing),
      and  not with Edge, which doesn&apos;t provide local storage for the file:// protocol.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      The next update will provide StoryTeller_Message.html, which should work for the file:// protocol with all
      three browsers.
