      Many students have asked &quot;How can I improve my design and implementation skills?&quot;.
      My answer is always something like this:
      <indent-block style="padding: 10px 0px;">
        Write lots of code, critisize your results using <a href="CppCodeAnalyzer.html">metrics analysis</a>
        and compare your code with established
        <a href="BlogPrinciples.html">design principles</a>.
      </indent-block>
      The next question is often &quot;Can you suggest projects for me to work on?&quot;. Here is a fairly
      detailed answer - a list of projects that range from
      simple exercises to quite challenging multi-package, multi-process systems.

            Serialize using the insertion operator, operator&lt;&lt;, and de-serialize using the
            extraction operator, operator&gt;&gt;.  You should probably provide a base class or
            template policy for persistance, so it is easy to add persistance to an existing class.

            <h4>The idea:</h4>
            <comment-block>
              Build a cross-platform code and document repository that uses pluggable components to define core Repository services.
            </comment-block>
            The goal of this project is to support management of code and documents using pluggable components for:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Storage:</strong><br />
                The mechanics for managing directories and placement of files.  Means for identifying the root of dependency chains,
                identifying Systems, Modules, and Packages.  Are categories used? Are they based on namespaces?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dependency Information:</strong><br />
                How dependency information is stored and accessed, e.g., with metadata XML files or with a NoSql database.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Versioning:</strong><br />
                How are versions tracked? How does a user explore the version sequence of a specified package?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ownership:</strong><br />
                Are packages owned by a single developer? by a group? by any registered Repository user?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Checkin and Checkout Process:</strong><br />
                How are open (incomplete) checkins and closed (complete) checkins identified and managed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Browsing:</strong><br />
                What kind of information is supplyed to the user to browse the Repository structure.  This is related to how
                storage is managed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Building:</strong><br />
                When and how packages are built into libraries.  How are Graphical User Interface (GUI) codes handled.
                How are codes from different languages handled.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Components will be defined using interfaces and object factories.  There needs to be a component installation interface
            that allows a component to register with, and be activated by, the Repository.  Since some of these services need to
            use other services, there needs to be a way for them to communicate.  One way is to use function call interfaces, but that
            means that every component may need to know the interfaces of many other components.  That isn't a good idea as it
            promotes a very tight coupling between components.
            <div style="height:15px"></div>
            One nice solution to this problem is to use message-passing communcation between components, as well as between the
            Repository and its Clients.  This way each component has to support a &quot;PostMessage(Message)&quot; interface where
            the parameters of the call are encoded into the body of the message.  The message has a "from" and "to" property
            so that the Repository's message dispatcher knows where to send the message, and the message recipient knows where to
            send a reply.  Yes, you can support <a href="../../Repository/CppProperties">properties</a> in C++.
            <div style="height:15px"></div>
            One interesting question is how the Repository will be hosted.  Here some options:
            <div>
              <ul class="tight">
                <li>C++ Process</li>
                <li>
                  Web interface using the MEAN stack.  Here, MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js.
                </li>
                <li>Asp.Net MVC</li>

              C++ Tiny HTTP Web Server and HTTP Client
            </summary>
            <h4>The idea:</h4>
            <div class="indent">
              Building block for C++ message-passing communication channels, servers, and other internet enabled programs.
            </div>
            <div style="height:15px"></div>
            The goal of this project is to implement small and simple components, HTTPClient and HTTPServer, used to build message passing communication
            channels in C++ on both Windows and Linux.  Those can be
            used to communicate between any two platforms that support native code, e.g., Windows, Linux, Unix, Macs, etc.  The most important measure
            of success for this project is to create a small code base to efficiently send messages with very low complexity for the using applications.
            <div style="height:15px"></div>
            This project will use sockets (you may use a sockets package found in the Repository) to send HTTP style messages.  Each message has a header
            consisting of text lines - the first is a command, and subsequent lines are attributes that describe the message with key:value pairs, e.g.,
            content-length:543 implies that the header is followed by a block of 543 bytes of data.  The HTTPClient and HTTPServer components will be
            developed for both Windows and Linux platforms.  Another measure of success is the ratio of common code to that which is unique for each
            platform.  Ideally that ratio should be large.
            <div style="height:15px"></div>
            You may re-implement one of your class projects that used WCF or another socket implementation.  Alternately, you may collaborate with
            one or two other students working on a project that requires message-passing communication.
            <div style="height:15px"></div>
            <div class="notecallout" style="padding:7px;">
              You will find a prototype for HttpServer <a href="../../CSE687/Repository/CppHttpClientServer">here</a>.
              Since the prototype does a lot of the implementation for windows, you will be expected to extend that in one
              or more of the following ways:
              <ul class="tight">
                <li>port to linux - already done, but needs some additional testing (I don't know of any bugs, but ...)</li>
                <li>interoperate with java which uses the Apache HttpClient and HttpServer components</li>
                <li>Use as the basis for supporting microservices</li>
              </ul>
              <div style="background-color:cornsilk; color:darkred; border:2px solid darkred; padding:10px; margin:20px;">
                Note: The prototype server uses a single-threaded apartment model, which works fine for asynchronous
                communication, but <strong>does not</strong> for synchronous communication like standard HTTP.
                The issue is that when making synchronous calls the caller waits for a response, and you have
                to either simply send an acknowledgement, or else use a multi-threaded apartment model for the
                server.

            <summary>Use Ajax Protocols, HTML5, and Tiny Web Server to build a cross-platform GUI</summary>
            <h4>The idea:</h4>
            <div class="indent">
              GUI built from Chrome using HTML5 and Tiny HTTPServer that will run on Windows and Linux with no changes
              other than recompiling the C++ HTTPServer.
            </div>
            <div style="height:15px;"></div>
            The .Net framework on Windows provides an elegant UI framework called Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
            On Linux there are a lot of GUI frameworks<sup><a href="#FOOT">2</a></sup> that work well but don't provide the declarative
            programming style that WCF exposes through Xaml.  The intent of this project is to provide a new alternative
            that works for Windows, Linux, and Macs, based on use of the Chrome browser and one or more HTML5 pages to
            support declarative layout of the user interface.
            <div style="height:15px;"></div>
            Each application that uses this new framework will host a tiny HTTPServer, as developed in the first project,
            and, on startup will start Chrome with an appropriate HTML5 page and Javascript library.
            Communication between the application and chrome is based on Ajax calls, e.g., a button click will send
            a message to the application to do something that usually will not result in downloading a new page to Chrome.
            The application performs the requested action and returns any information that needs to be displayed, probably
            using JSON or XML.
            <div style="height:15px;"></div>
            The result is that we can build cross-platform applications using the support libraries, developed in the
            preceeding project, application code that is common to both platforms, and GUI code that is also common to
            both platfroms.

              Platform Tools - build platform wrappers (Windows, Linux) used by common code, e.g., Process handler, Sockets,
              Shared memory handler, ...
            </summary>
            <h4>The idea:</h4>

              Platform specific libraries with common interfaces to support common code across multiple platforms.
            </div>
            <div style="height:15px;"></div>
            This project extends an existing C++ library of low-level program support components for both Windows and Linux.
            The idea is that each component provides the same interface on all supported platforms, but uses the operating system APIs
            to implement the interfaces. The current library has classes to manipulate files and directories for both Windows and Linux.
            To that, this project will add, for both Windows and Linux:
            <ul class="tight">
              <li>
                FileSystem library (already complete for both Windows and Linux - see <a href="../../CSE687/Repository/FileSystem-Windows">FileSystem-Windows</a>).
                It would be interesting to reimplement based on std::FileSystem (C++17 : Microsoft C++ supports an experimental version).
                That has an interface based on directory_entry and iterators, which is harder to use than my FileSystem-Windows.  I used essentially
                the same design as the .Net System.IO classes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sockets library, probably based on the library provided in Handouts/Repository.
                This will focus mostly on porting the existing Windows library to Linux and testing the result.
              </li>
              <li>
                Process library to create, start, and communicate with new processes.  This will use the Windows and Linux APIs
                to implement a Process class with some of the capability of the .Net Process class.
              </li>
              <li>
                Thread Pool (already complete for Windows - See Repository, this may run on Linux as-is, but needs testing),
                using C++11 threading and locking constructs.
                This will involve creating a specified number of threads
                that block on a thread-safe blocking queue waiting to dequeue lambdas that define the work to be
                done<sup><a href="#FOOT">1</a></sup>.
              </li>

            <h4>The idea:</h4>
            <div class="indent">
              Compose programs from small service components with message-passing communication.
            </div>
            <div style="height:15px"></div>
            Microservices are small, self-contained, building blocks used to create larger systems.  The
            application aggregates a number of services to implement as much of its functionality as is
            practical.  The application code instantiates services it intends to use and communicates with
            them using messages.
            <div style="height:15px"></div>
            If the services reside in seperate processes, then the design uses socket-based
            asynchronous messaging with HTTP style messages.  If a service resides in the same process
            as the application code, then messages are sent directly to the receiver's queue.
            <div style="height:15px"></div>
            Application design focuses on selecting a set of services and configuring messages to
            support application activities.
            This project, of course, will have to build an initial set of services, based on a specified
            service architecture.
            <div style="height:15px"></div>
            <div class="notecallout" style="padding:7px;">
              You could select a modestly complex project and implement with services, as described above,
              perhaps building a directory synchronizer.  Alternately, you could join a team that was building
              a TestHarness or Repository and implement that with microservices.

            <h4>The idea:</h4>
            <div>
              This project is similar in function to SMA's Project #4, Fall 2016, and OOD&apos;s Project #4, Fall 2018. It is
              implemented in C++, using a <a href="processpool.pdf">process pool</a> to enable execution of libraries in isolation, instead of using C# and .Net AppDomains.
              It will still support high performance execution, but also enables testing of libraries from different technologies, e.g., C++, C#, and Java.
              <div style="background-color:cornsilk; color:darkred; border:2px solid darkred; padding:10px; margin:20px;">
                If you completed OOD in the Fall of 2018, to do this project, you will have to extend it in
                interesting ways.  Please discuss this with me before making this choice.
              </div>
            </div>
            <div style="height:15px"></div>
            <strong>The goal of this project</strong> is to support testing of more than one type of code.  It does this by defining a base process class
            that supports process creation and communication with the main TestHarness process.  Derived classes are defined to support
            a particular type of code execution, e.g., managed C# or Java code, or native C and C++ code.
            <div style="height:15px"></div>
            This project will use C++ sockets to build a message-passing communication system, and C++ code to develop the TestHarness,
            Process class for loading and executing C and C++ library code, and a demonstration client.
            <div style="height:15px"></div>
            The process class for testing C# code will be written in C++, but is intended to support starting and communicating with
            a process written in C# that loads C# libraries, and may use a C++\CLI wrapper to communicate with
            the Testharness.
            <div style="height:15px"></div>
            The process class for testing Java code will be written in C++, but is intended to support starting and communicating
            with a process written in Java, that loads Java libraries and will use Java sockets to communicate with the Testharness.
