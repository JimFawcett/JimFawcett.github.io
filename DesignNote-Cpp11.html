  <strong>New and modified Language Features:</strong>
  <p>
    The C++ programming language has been standardized in 1998, 2003, and again in 2011, with a new standard revision approved in 2014 and a significant revision expected in 2017.
    The Visual Studio 2013 C++ compiler implements most of the 2011 changes and a few of the 2014 changes.  The 2011 changes are discussed on this page.

    <li class="tight">
      <strong>compiler created functions:</strong><p></p>
      Every class designer should consciously decide to implement these, or use the compiler generated versions, or prohibit them.  Generated members will be
      correct only if every data member of the class has correct semantics for each one. Usually if we implement one then we do so for all.
      <span class="note">Note:</span> if any constructor or destructor has an =default suffix then the compiler will generate that operation.  We won't
      keep stating this for each of the functions below.

      <ul class="tight">
        <li>
          <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/default_constructor">default constructor</a>
          <div class="indent">
            <strong>T()</strong><br />
            Create an instance with default initialization (defined by the body of this function)
            for creation of single instances and arrays of instances.
            <p></p>
            The compiler generates this only if no constructors are declared in your class and your code attempts an unparmaterized construction.
            Its action is to call a default construction on each of the bases and data members of your class.
          </div>
        </li>

            Create copy for pass and return by value. Creates instance and copies state from the source.
            <p></p>
            The compiler always generates this if not declared in your class, no move operations are declared, and your code attempts a copy, as in pass or return by value.
            Its action is to call a copy construction on each of the bases and data members of your class.

          <div class="indent">
            <strong>T(T&amp;&amp; t)</strong><br />
            Create instance by moving contents of source, used for return by value and create from temporary.  Often this entails making
            the target point to state created by the source instance, on the heap, and setting the souce pointer to nullptr.
            <p></p>
            The compiler will generate this if it's not declared and implied by code that uses the class and copy assignment, move assignment, and copy
            construction are not
            declared.  Its action is to do memberwise move construction on bases and data members that are movable and copy construction
            on those that are not.

            <p></p>
            The compiler will always generate this if it's not declared and implied by code that uses the class.  Its action is to do
            memberwise assignment on all the bases and members of the class.

            Move state of source into existing object.  State handled in a fashion similar to move construction.
            <p></p>
            The compiler will generate this if it's not declared and no copy or move constructors, or copy assignment are declared.  Its action is to do memberwise
            move assignment on all the bases and data members of the class.

      <strong>auto</strong><span class="note">(C++11)</span>
      <div class="indent pad">
        auto is a type defined by the compiler, not the designer, using type inference.  It requires initialization and guarantees no temporaries are created.
        The designer can override the compiler's inference as shown in the second and fourth lines below.  In this case there may be temporaries created.<p></p>
        auto var { item };<br />

    <li>
      <strong>range-for:</strong><span class="note">(C++11)</span>
      <div class="indent pad">
        range-for works with any container type that provides iterators and begin() and end() functions.  This includes all the STL containers, std::array,
        and std::string. In the first line c is a copy of the next container element.  In the second line c is a reference to the next container element and
        so can be used to modify that element's value.<p></p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>nullptr:</strong><span class="note">(C++11)</span>
      <div class="indent pad">
        nullptr is a replacement for 0 and NULL for initializing pointers.  It is used to indicate that a pointer does not reference initialized memory.
        The language guarantees that deleting a nullptr does nothing.<p></p>
        T* ptr = nullptr;<br />
        unique_ptr&lt;T&gt; ptr(nullptr);
      </div>
      <div class="pad"></div>

    <li>
      <strong>constexpr:</strong><span class="note">(C++11) - not implemented in Visual Studio 2013</span>
      <div class="indent pad">
        A constexpr is an expression or function that can be evaluated at compile-time.<p></p>
        constexp sum = 1 + 2 + 3;<br />

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>decltype(T):</strong><span class="note">(C++11)</span>
      <div class="indent pad">
        If the argument is the unparenthesised name of an object or function or is a member access expression, e.g., object.member or pointer->member
        then decltype specifies the declared type of T.<p></p>
        If the argument is any other expression of type T then:
        <ul class="tight">
          <li>If the value category of T is xvalue then decltype specifies T&amp;&amp;</li>
          <li>If the value category of T is lvalue then decltype specifies T&</li>

    <li>
      <strong>override and final:</strong><span class="note">(C++11)</span>
      <div class="indent pad">
        <strong>override</strong> is an optional post-qualifier for virtual functions in a derived class.  It causes compiler checking to verify that the function has exactly
        the same name and type sequence as a base class virtual function.  This avoids the compiler treating a function (with spelling errors) as an overload
        instead of the override the designer intended.<p></p>
        <strong>final</strong> is a post-qualifier that prohibits overriding qualified virtual member functions and using qualified classes as inherited bases.
      </div>
      <div class="pad"></div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>variadic templates:</strong><span class="note">(C++11)</span>
      <div class="indent pad">
        Variadic templates support writing functions that take an arbitrary number of arguments.
        <p />
        template &lt;typename C, typename T, typename... Args&gt; void inserter(C& c, T&& t, Args&&... args) { /* another body */ }<br />
        template &lt;typename c, typename t&gt; void inserter(C& c, T&& t) { /* body */ }
        <p></p>
        The first template function accepts an arbitrary finite number of moveable items of type T and processes the first one and calls itself
        recursively to handle the remainer.  The second function is a template specialization that stops the recursion.
        <p></p>
        The set of type parameters in a variadic template is referred to as a &quot;Parameter Pack&quot;

      <div class="smallpad"></div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>noexcept:</strong> <span class="note">C++11</span>
      <p></p>
      noexcept is a specification that can be part of a function declarator.
      <p>
        <div class="indent">
          Void fun (int i) noexcept
        </div>
      </p>
      If the body of the function throws an unhandled exception std::terminate()
      is called by default.
      <p></p>
      <div class="pad"></div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>literals</strong>
      <p>
        Literals are compile-time constants.  The specifiers below allow us to be fairly specific about the literal type
        to avoid needing silent conversions when there is a compatible type mismatch in code expressions.

            std::unique_ptr is a smart pointer that represents sole ownership of a resource created on the heap.
            Its action is to provide access to its owned object through standard pointer syntax and to delete the
            object when it goes out of scope.
            <p></p>
            You must be careful not to initialize two or more std::unique_ptrs with the same raw pointer as that will
            cause delete to be called more than once on the owned object with undefined behavior.

            std::shared_ptr is a smart reference counted pointer that represents shared ownership of a resource created on the heap.
            When a shared pointer goes out of scope it decrements its reference count.  Only if the count goes to zero is the resource
            deleted.
            <p></p>
            You must be careful not to create more than one std::shared_ptr from a raw pointer.  After the first is created you must
            create the remainder from an already defined std::shared_ptr sharing the same resource.

      <strong>initializer-list:</strong> <span class="note">C++11</span>
      <p>
        std::initializer-list is a class that supports initializing declared primitives, structs, classes, and containers with the values they will hold
        on startup. Here are two samples:
      </p>
      <div class="indent">
        int x { -5 };<br />
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; vint { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
      </div>
      <p>
        You need to be careful when the type you are initializing has a constructor that takes a single parameter.  If your syntax uses braces instead of
        parentheses, then the initializer list will be used rather than the constructor you intended.

      <strong>tuple:</strong> <span class="note">C++11</span>
      <p>
        std::tuple&lt;T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, ...&gt; is a class that holds a fixed number of instances of arbitrary types.  It is a generalization of std::pair&lt;F, S&gt;.
        the std::make_tuple(Args... args) is a variadic template function designed to make it easy to construct tuples.  The non-member function
        std::get&lt;n&gt;(std::tuple) provides access to a tuple's nth member instance.

      <strong>regex:</strong> <span class="note">C++11</span>
      <p>
        Regular Expressions are strings with a particular syntax that makes it easy to specify exactly what a search should match.
        There are special characters for the beginning and end of a search string, ways to specify that any of a set of characters
        are acceptable at some place in the string and so forth.  The standard C++ library now has std::regex, a regular expression
        processor that you may find useful.
      <p></p>
      <a href="http://regexone.com/">here</a>'s a tutorial.  You will also find a nice expositions in &quot;The C++ Programming Language&quot; starting on
      page 1051 and in &quot;The C++ Standard Library&quot; starting on page 717.  These are our two required texts.

        that we will discuss later in the semester.  I recommend that you wait awhile before looking at these.  You will need to be quite comfortable with
        C++11 to get much out of the examples.

      There have been a number of relatively useful algorithms in the standard library.  The table below lists a few of the ones I use occasionally.  I've also
      included several that have been added with the new C++11 standard.
      <p></p>
      Note that all of the STL algorithms treat [start_iter, end_iter) as a closed open interval.  That is, start_iter points to the first element processed
      and end_iter points to one <strong>past</strong> the last element processed.
