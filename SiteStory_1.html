    <h3 class="squeeze">Purpose of the Site:</h3>
    <indent-block>
      <div id="fig1"></div><div id="fig2"></div>
      This site is intended to provide access to, and documentation for, a collection
      of code resources.  Much of the code was
      developed for my Syracuse University classes. New code will appear here for other things of
      interest now.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      Another intent is to experiment with ways to document and deploy code:  how to provide
      quick access to important code fragments without impeding delivery of the entire product,  how to
      balance browser view space between non-trivial text descriptions, diagrams, and images,  and how to provide
      intuitive navigation through large collections of code and resources.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      This site currently has more than forty repositories, with many more coming.  That is almost industrial
      scale, and so, we believe that what we do here is applicable for commercial and industrial development
      of software as well.
    </indent-block>

    <h3 class="squeeze">Story Contents:</h3>
    <indent-block>
      The plotline for this story focuses on the things we are doing to achive those goals, in particular,
      experiments to test ideas for structuring code to make it easy to deploy into user applications
      and to test ways of explaining code so concept, design, and operations of the code are
      clear; and do so with a reasonable amount of effort.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      A fundamental assumption we make is that deploying code from the cloud - we are using github - and documenting it with pages
      from a static website, hosted from the same location, is an effective start.  We take that as given, and proceed
      from there. So let&apos;s start with where we are now.
    </indent-block>
    <h3>Site Structure:</h3>
    <indent-block>
      <div id="fig3"></div>
      The gateway into site contents is the Home page, shown in Figure 1. Its top menu provides access either
      directly or indirectly to all the site contents. The most important destination is the Repositories page,
      shown in Figure 2.  That leads to each of the repositories via tables that provide summary information or,
      more directly, through its top menu providing direct access to each of the repositories.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      Various parts are shown in Figure 3. The main characters in this SiteStory are the Repositories and Stories.
      <h4>Repositories:</h4>
      <indent-block>
        Repositories are where we store all the code to be deployed.  Each repository has a documentation
        page and code.  For example the CppUtilities repository documentation page is
        <a href="CppUtilities.html">CppUtilities.html</a> and the code resides in
        <a href="https://github.com/JimFawcett/CppUtilities">https://github.com/JimFawcett/CppUtilities.html</a>.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        <!--Each documentation page is intended to have:
        <ul class="tight pad10">
          <li>
            Concept statement - a few sentences that describe the mission of the code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Usage - how the code will be used by people or other software.
          </li>
          <li>
            Design - text and UML diagrams giving an abstract view of the code&apos;s structure
            and responsibilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Status - any known deficiencies and plans for improvement.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Each repository has code that builds to a static library and provides an interface and
        object factory for other code to initialize and use it.  It also is expected to have a small
        demonstration program and a larger suite of test cases.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        At this point in time a lot of that remains to be put in place.  All the repositories have
        demonstration code, but only one, FileSystem, has a reasonably complete test suite.-->
      </indent-block>
      <h4>Stories:</h4>
      <indent-block>
        The other principal feature we will discuss is the provision of stories. A
        <a href="Stories.html">Story</a> is a sequence of resources - mostly pages - drawn from this site
        that have a common theme.  The theme of this story, for example, is the evolution of this site
        to provide an effective means for documenting and deploying software.
        <!--<spacer-15></spacer-15>
        Other stories published here already:
        <ul class="tight pad10">
          <li>
            C++ Story - introduction or refresher for C++, used to develop most of the code in this site.
          </li>
          <li>
            &#8734; Data Library - a guest story outlining a very ambitious and interesting library for capturing
            research data.
          </li>
          <li>
            MLiPS - a guest story proposing an interesting pipeline for Natural Language Processing implemented
            using PowerShell cmdlets.
          </li>
          <li>
            SiteStory - the story you are now reading.
          </li>
        </ul>
        I expect to create additional stories for the design of the StoryTeller, the design of this site,
        and to invite more guest story tellers.
        Stories appear to be an engaging and useful way to introduce topics relevant to the
        repositories and the process of documenting them, as well as provide a forum for guests to describe
        interesting things they are working on.-->
