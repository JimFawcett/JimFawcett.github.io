    <h3>UML Diagrams</h3>
    <indent-block>
      Universal Modeling Diagrams (UML) are diagrams that provide very useful abstractions for object-oriented code.
      There are many diagram types. The most often used are discussed here.

                  A package is, for C++, a pair of files - header and implementation.  The header file (*.h)
                  contains prologue comments that describe the responsibilities of the package, declarations
                  and inline definitions.  The implementation file (*.cpp) contains all definitions not
                  contained in the header.  It also contains a test stub that is enclosed by a preprocessor
                  definition that allows it to be included for stand-alone testing, and excluded for use
                  with other code.
                  <spacer-15></spacer-15>
                  A package diagram shows each of the packages in a design, using a package symbol,
                  and shows their dependency relationships.  In Figure 1. we show the package diagram for TextFinder,
                  one of the tools from our code repositories.  The package reponsibilities are:
                  <ul class="tight pad10">
                    <li>
                      TextFinder is responsible for finding every file, in a specified directory tree, that
                      contains text matching a specified regular expression.  It does that using services of
                      the other packages shown
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      CodeUtilities provides processing of the program&apos;s command line, capturing each of
                      the options specified there, and encapsulating them for use later in the program.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      DirExplorerT is a reusable directory navigator that does a recursive depth first search
                      of a specified directory tree.  For each directory and file encountered, it calls doDir
                      and doFile methods in a class that manages application specific details.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      FileSystem is used by DirExplorerT to discover directories and files using the Windows API.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Application is an application specific class that defines processing for directories and
                      files.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      TextSearch defines how text files are opened and searched for regular expression matches.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  Notice that the package diagram, augmented with package responsibilities, gives a quite clear
                  top-level appreciation for the operations of this facility.

                  A class declares, and provides the facilities to construct, manipulate, and destroy
                  encapsulated state, e.g., fundamental language types or library entities like vectors and deques.
                  <spacer-15></spacer-15>
                  A class diagram shows each of the classes in a package, using one of two class symbols - see Fig 2,
                  and shows their relationships.  Classes have four kinds of relationships with other classes:
                  inheritance, composition, aggregation, and using.
                  <spacer-15></spacer-15>
                  Inheritance is shown with a triangle symbol pointing to a base class and line extending to one or
                  more derived classes.  It represents an &quot;is-a&quot; relationship, as in a student is-a person.
                  <spacer-15></spacer-15>
                  Composition is shown with a solid diamond that is adjacent to the composer with a line reaching
                  to the composed class.  Composition is a strong ownership relationship.  The composer and composed
                  have the same life-time.  The composed is an integral part of the composer.
                  <spacer-15></spacer-15>
                  Aggregation is shown with a hollow diamond that is adjacent to the aggregator with a line extending
                  to the aggregated class.  Aggregation is a weaker ownership relationship.  An aggregated part may
                  or may not exist throughout the lifetime of the aggregator.  It is created and disposed by the
                  aggregating class.  Aggregation may occur when a method of the aggregator creates the aggregated
                  instance on the native heap.  It may also occur when the aggregator creates a local instance
                  of the aggregated in one of its methods.
                  <spacer-15></spacer-15>
                  Using is a non-owning relationship, shown by an arrow directed from the user to the used.
                  Instances of used classes are passed to the user as a reference argument in one of its methods.
                  <spacer-15></spacer-15>
                  These diagrams present an abstract representation of a design, in that they disclose no code,
                  but they do present its logical structure.
                  <spacer-15></spacer-15>
                  In Figure 2. we show the classes for TextFinder. TextFinder inherits the interface ITextFinder,
                  composes an instance of DirExplorerT&lt;Application&gt;, and aggregates an instance of TextSearch.
                  It does that by creating the instance as a local data member of its searchFile method.  Application
                  uses TextFinder through its interface ITextFinder.  Finally, DirExplorerT&lt;Application&gt;
                  composes an instance of ProcessCmdLine.  We haven&apos;t shown the FileSystem classes as they are
                  implementation details of the DirExplorerT&lt;Application&gt; class.
                  <spacer-15></spacer-15>
                  We see that the Application class is used as
                  a template parameter for DirExplorerT&lt;Application&gt;.  Its methods doDir and doFile provide
                  application specific processing so that DirExplorerT&lt;Application&gt; can be used without
                  modification.  We&apos;ve seen that Application uses the interface ITextFinder
                  (to access it&apos;s searchFile
                  method).  Because ITextFinder is an interface, Application can use TextFinder without incurring a
                  build dependency.  TextFinder uses the Application class definition to instantiate an instance
                  of DirExplorerT&lt;Application&gt;.

                  Processing activities are shown as process &quot;bubbles&quot; connected with directed
                  lines that describe processing flow. Every processing activity has at least one entering flow
                  and at least one
                  exit flow. There is always one initial flow indicated with a filled circle at the beginning
                  end.  There are always one or more exit flows that terminate on a hollow circle that contains
                  a filled circle.
                  <spacer-15></spacer-15>
                  I&apos;ve shown bidirectional flows to represent flow from one process to another and then back.
                  It is conventional to use two one-way flows in these diagrams.  The bidirectional flows were used
                  because the tool I used to generate them doesn&apos;t provide enough anchor points on the process
                  bubbles.
                  <spacer-15></spacer-15>
                  &quot;Swim-lanes&quot; are optionally used to show how processing is packaged in a design.
                  That was done in Figure 3. for TextFinder.  That helps us understand the sequence of calls
                  made between packages and when they occur.

        <summary><strong>Activity Diagrams with Synchronization:</strong></summary>
        <indent-block>
          <splitter-container style="margin:15px 0px 20px 0px;">
            <first-item id="fig4-first" style="width:60%; background-color:#ffffff;">

                <indent-block class="indent">
                  There is one more feature that may be used in activity diagrams, not shown in Figure 3.,
                  synchronization bars.  In Figure 4. we show processing activity for a message-passing
                  communication channel.  That diagram uses several synchronizing bars to indicate places
                  where processing may wait and where it may fork processing into concurrent activities.
                  <spacer-15></spacer-15>
                  A synchronization bar is a filled narrow rectangle that may be either horizontal or vertical,
                  based on the needs of the diagram.  Each synchronizer represents a place where processing must
                  wait, as for a deQueue operation or in a form waiting for user input, or where processing
                  may fork by creating a child thread or process.
                  <spacer-15></spacer-15>
                  The message-passing diagram illustrates activities that occur in a communication channel,
                  where sender&apos;s messages are enQueued and later deQueued for processing.  Also, they are
                  used to represent the channel connection activity.
                  <spacer-15></spacer-15>
                  There are specific semantics for multiple inputs to a synchronizer and multiple outputs from
                  a synchronizer:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Mulitple inputs to a synchronizer indicate that no processing on the output side can
                      occur until all of the input processing activities have completed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Multiple outputs from a synchronizer indicate that each output is independent of the others
                      and are forked for concurrent processing.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  This is an extraordinarily useful representation, helping us to understand timing relationships
                  between a program&apos;s processing parts.
                  <spacer-15></spacer-15>
                  Note that the processing &quot;bubbles&quot; often correspond to processing in a single function.
                  However, there is no mandate for that.  We collect activities into a single process in any way that
                  helps a reader to understand the design.
