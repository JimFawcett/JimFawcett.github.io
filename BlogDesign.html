  <h3>Initial Thoughts:</h3>
  Design of software encompasses many things:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Concept:</strong><br />
      Ideas about the project's functionality, who the users are, what they need, and any critical issues about how those
      needs will be served, e.g., usability, complexity, safety, security, and robustness.

        <topic-block class="tight">
          <spacer-10></spacer-10>
          Let's explore a project concept by looking at the projects for <a href="CSE687.htm">CSE687 - Object Oriented Design</a>,
          Fall 2018.
          <spacer-10></spacer-10>
          <ul class="tight">
            <li>
              In <strong>Project #1</strong> we built a <a href="../CSE687/Lectures/Project1-F2018.htm">single-user test harness</a>
              that executes a sequence of tests, each of which implements an ITest interface,
              in the context of a try-catch block and reports results, using an
              executor class, so that we don&apos;t need to write multiple try-catch blocks and don&apos;t need to write multiple
              IO statements.  You will find a diagram in the Project #1 statement, linked above, that shows how all the projects
              will fit together to result in a useful testing facility for a professional project.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Project #2</strong> packages the single-user test harness into a stand-alone executable that will
              become part of a <a href="../CSE687/Lectures/Project2-F2018.htm">multi-user test harness</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Project #3</strong> builds a <a href="../CSE687/Lectures/Project3-F2018.htm">process pool</a> that uses asynchronous
              message-passing communication to support control and message passing between a test harness and it&apos;s child
              tester processes, so that tests can run concurrently without danger of rouge test code taking down the whole test harness.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, <strong>Project #4</strong> adds a Graphical User Interface, based on C# Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
              that builds a <a href="../CSE687/Lectures/Project4-F2018.htm">Remote Test Harness</a>, by interoperating with our C++ communication channel through a C++\CLI translater, that converts messages and calls
              from managed C# to native C++ and back.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <spacer-10></spacer-10>
          The concept for this sequence is nicely illustrated by the diagrams, presented in each of the project statements, linked above.
          Each project progressively adds functionality to the results of previous projects, much like agile &quot;sprints&quot;.
          <spacer-10></spacer-10>
          Users for each project, except the last, are other software components.  Developers and Quality Assurance Engineers are
          the users of the final project.
          <spacer-10></spacer-10>
          The project structure is shown clearly by the diagrams presented in statements for Projects
          <a href="../CSE687/Lectures/Project1-F2018.htm">#1</a>,
          <a href="../CSE687/Lectures/Project1-F2018.htm">#2</a>,
          <a href="../CSE687/Lectures/Project1-F2018.htm">#3</a>,
          <a href="../CSE687/Lectures/Project1-F2018.htm">#4</a>.
          <spacer-10></spacer-10>
          Critical issues are concerned mostly with usability of the multi-user test harness.  If it isn&apos;t easy to use
          developers and quality assurance will find other ways to do their testing, and this development will be wasted effort.
          <spacer-10></spacer-10>
        </topic-block>
        <spacer-25></spacer-25>
        Design usually begins with <a href="BlogOCD.htm">concept development</a> - establishing user needs, critical issues, and
        top level package structure.  Making a list of Tasks the software must complete to satisfy
        user needs is often a good way to start.  Each task is a candidate to become a top-level package.
        We want our packages to be focused on a single activity so they are cohesive.  We want them to be
        independently testable and composable with top-level packages for the other tasks.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        The project concept is its most abstract description and should be invariant over the lifetime
        of the development.  Specifications may change because neither customers nor developers have
        perfect foresight.  But they both need an invariant top-level view of the project even though many concrete details
        may be changing; the concept document plays this role.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Abstractions:</strong><br />
      Abstractions are conceptual models for the entities that are part of a software design.
      Entities are concrete things from the problem domain like products and orders, customers, employees,
      and also for the solution domain, like Parsers, Tasks, ThreadPools, etc.,  where we may need to build complex
      data structures that define and manage program state.
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      <more-less>More</more-less>
      <div class="hider">
        Developing problem domain abstractions usually comes early in the design process, and that development may be obvious for domain experts.
        Having a set of abstractions helps us define
        the parts that make up a system and the actions the parts take during the system's lifetime.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        Frequently abstractions turn into classes of the same name.  We use the class relationships: inheritance,
        composition, aggregation, and using to model behaviors of the problem domain entities and actors.
        These are captured with the Universal Modeling Language (UML) - class, activity, and sequence diagrams.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        The process of defining abstractions and building their concrete representations continues in the
        solution domain.  For the solution parts aliases can be a useful tool for thinking about and building
        that part's abstraction.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        <topic-block class="tight">
          <spacer-10></spacer-10>
          The C++11 using construct represents an alias for some type.  Here's an example declaring a symbol table abstraction
          with aliases:
          <div>
            <pre style="font-family:Consolas,monospace; font-weight:bold;">
      template&lt;typename typeinfo&gt;
      class SymbolTable
      {
      public:
        using Type = std::string;
        using Name = std::string;
        using Record = std::tuple&lt;type, name, typeinfo&gt;
        using Records = std::vector&lt;record&gt;
 
        void add(const Record& record) { _records.push_back(record); }
        Record& operator[](size_t i);
        Record operator[](size_t i) const;
        Records FindName(const Name& name);
        Records FindType(const Type& type);
        Records GetRecords() { return _records;  }
      private:
        Records _records;
      };
        </pre>
            <div class="indent">
              We want to build the symbol table to record results of a type analysis, as outlined in the next paragraph.  A record in the symbol table
              will hold information about a declaration, e.g., its type, name of the instance, and additional information like file name and line numbers.
              <spacer-10></spacer-10>
              We&apos;re not sure yet about all the details, so we represent that by a template parameter and bind it all together into a symbol table
              record using a tuple.
            </div>
          </div>
          <spacer-10></spacer-10>
        </topic-block>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Flow of Execution:</strong><br />
      What computational activites are needed and how will they be ordered?
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      <more-less>More</more-less>
      <div class="hider">
        Building a task list also helps us decide on an execution model.  How must the tasks be ordered?
        Are there opportunities for parallel execution?  Should computation be configured into two or more
        phases each of which makes some specific transformations on the project's working state?
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        <div class="indent">
          For example, suppose that we want to analyze dependency between files based on use of types,
          global functions, and global data.  If File A uses a type or global function or data defined
          in File B then A depends on B.
          <spacer-15></spacer-15>
          So, in Pass #1, we will <a href="blogParser.htm">parse</a> each
          file in our working set to discover the types, global functions, and global data it defines,
          and store that in a symbol table along with the file name.
          <spacer-15></spacer-15>
          In Pass #2, we simply tokenize
          each file and check to see if each token is a key in the symbol table.  If so, this file depends
          on the file stored in the symbol table for that key.
        </div>
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        Building a data flow model may also be a good way to start thinking about execution.  We need to ask what
        input data state is required for a task to carry out its assignment.  How does that task need to restructure
        its input and what new data must it generate for the next task to consume?
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        <div class="indent">
          For file dependency analysis the input working set consists of the file set.  The output of Pass #1
          consists of a symbol table holding names of all the types, global functions, and global data along with
          the name of the file where defined.
          <spacer-15></spacer-15>
          Pass #2 uses the file set and symbol table to generate a set of dependency relationships between
          files.  We might represent that with XML or Json or links in a database table.
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Structure:</strong><br />
      Structure is some arrangement of parts.  For software development the parts are:
      <ul class="tight">
        <li>
          Functions and classes - the fundamental units of design.
        </li>
        <li>
          Packages - collections of functions and classes in one or two source code files focused on a single activity.  For C and C++ a package has two
          files, a header file with declarations and inline definitions, and an implementation
          file containing the non-inline functions and a main function where execution may begin<sup>1</sup>.
          A package in Java or C# is a single file containing these same parts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Modules - collections of packages that combine to deliver some major functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Programs - combinations of modules that provide everything required to build an executable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Systems - combinations of programs that offer a complete working product.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <more-less>More</more-less>
      <div class="hider">
        Design decides the names and functionalities of the principle parts and how they interact.  What dependencies are needed
        between the parts?
        What information has to be generated and made accessible by the parts?
        Here are several views of software structure:
        <ul class="tight">
          <li>
            Logical models using classes and class relationships
          </li>
          <li>
            Allocation of classes to packages and package dependencies
          </li>
          <li>
            Establishing module boundaries with interfaces and object factories
          </li>
          <li>
            Forking execution into threads and processes
          </li>
          <li>
            Packaging of execution in binary files - executables and loadable modules
          </li>
          <li>
            Distribution of execution across processes, machines, and networks
          </li>
        </ul>
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        Each task identified during concept development is a candidate for the
        operation of a package.  By this time we have a good idea of what that task needs to accomplish and
        what input state it needs to begin processing.  The data flow model tells us how we need to order and couple the packages
        into modules and programs.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        <topic-block class="tight">
          <spacer-10></spacer-10>
          Several of the structure views cited above are illustrated by a prototype I developed for a
          <a href="BlogMessagePassingComm.html">Message-passing Communication System</a>.  Message-passing is defined, here,
          with a class hierarchy of communicators, each of which has a blocking message queue and a child thread
          that processes received messages.  Find more details in <a href="BlogActiveObjects.html">Blog on Active Objects</a>.

          <div class="right clear" style="margin: 10px; padding: 10px;">
            <img name="CommObjs" width="620" onmouseover="CommObjs.width='620'" onmouseout="CommObjs.width='620'" src="Pictures/CommObjs.png" />
            <div class="center">Figure 2 - Document Vault Demo using Message Dispatching in the Server</div>
          </div>

          <spacer-15></spacer-15>
          These classes are allocated to packages for sending, receiving, and dispatching messages.  Additional
          communicator classes are used to define the behavior of clients and servers.
          <spacer-15></spacer-15>
          Communication activities are illustrated with an Activity Diagram which is a view of program tasks at
          a slightly lower level of detail.
          <spacer-15></spacer-15>
          Send and Receive communicators and their task-based communicator colleagues
          pass messages between machines in a network or across the internet. This allows us to conveniently
          distribute processing across client and server machines.  The server is the center for sharing
          resources between each of the clients which provide human access to the system.
          <spacer-15></spacer-15>
          Receive communicators contain a dispatcher that routes messages to named task-based communcators.
          The dispatcher serves as a mediator handling all message traffic into and out of the local process or machine.
          <spacer-15></spacer-15>
          Using a mediator makes adding new functionality very simple.  We derive a communicator from the AbstractCommunicator,
          register it with the dispatcher, and clients can immediately begin using the new functionality.  No other changes
          are needed.
          <spacer-10></spacer-10>
        </topic-block>
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        Tasks are a nice way of partitioning design and implementation effort.
        We can start building some of the task-based packages while we are still thinking about how to
        design and implement others.  This allows us to build incrementally and share development across
        multiple teams.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        For each package we may carry out the same process on a smaller scale to determine
        lower level package structure and operations.  Using these design views - Tasks, activities, classes, packages, and modules
        allows us to think critically about our project before we become emeshed in its implementation
        details.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Communication and Accessibility:</strong><br />
      How does information flow between the various parts and how are event notifications routed
      to parts with need to know?  Is information pushed by the creators or pulled by the
      consumers?
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      <more-less>More</more-less>
      <div class="hider">
        Communication is concerned with routing commands and event notifications as well as making
        data generated in one part of the code accessible to any other parts that need to use it.
        for example, an executive package communicates with each of its child packages, e.g., the packages that are responsible
        for each task of the program, to activate them at the appropriate phase of computation and may receive
        notifications of errors the child encountered.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        Often
        data flows between class instances in each top level package through method calls and may evolve
        in simple and intuitive ways.  However, as systems get larger data access may become considerably more
        complicated.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        Careful design of class ownership is the key to effective communication: a class has
        access to the public interface of its parts - composed and aggregated instances of other classes - and can directly send and receive data
        as well as issue commands to them and receive notifications from them.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        <div class="indent">
          The <a href="blogParser.htm">parser</a> is an interesting example of the use of ownership.
          Its object factory, configureParser, owns all the Rules and Actions that determine how parsing
          is executed.  When configureParser creates each action it passes a reference to a data Repository to them.
          Actions can store data and use data that other actions have added.  Thus an action
          can use the results of other actions that it otherwise has no access to.
        </div>
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        We can, of course, openly share data in ways that make it accessible throughout an entire process or
        even for any process running in the same machine.
        <ul class="tight">
          <li>
            We can declare a static member of some class and make it accessible through the class's public interface;
            then any other code running in the same process that declares an instance of the wrapper class has access to the static instance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Global data in C and C++ programs also provides process wide sharing, but in a much less
            controllable way and is usually avoided.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can also share through machine wide resources like files and shared memory.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        We occasionally resort to open sharing using one of these techniques but need to recognize
        that open sharing comes with costs: need to ensure thread-safe access in a concurrent environment,
        and problems with conflicts in use, e.g., two methods using the shared datum in conflicting ways.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        Open sharing makes it considerably more difficult to think critically about operations of the
        code and to ensure they are correct.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Error Handling:</strong><br />
      How are errors handled by the design?  Is each part responsible for it's own error handling
      or is there some central logging and reaction needed?  Errors often affect the system state.
      How is that state recovered or reinitialized?
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      <more-less>More</more-less>
      <div class="hider">
        Error handling comes in two parts - detection and recovery.  How we handle these is very much a
        function of the context in which the program operates.  If the program is a demonstration or prototype
        we may be fairly casual about managing errors.  If processing may affect usability, wealth, security, or safety,
        error handling becomes an essential ingredient in system design.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        You have these choices when faced with errors:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Assert that some condition is true.  That is an easy way to detect some forms of errors, but
            is useless for recovery since Asserts default to program termination.
          </li>

            Provide and use error codes as return values of functions.  That has been widely used.  It may
            be effective in some specific situations - did my socket connect to its endpoint?  In general, though,
            we make frequent checks for rare events.  That doesn't seem like a good use of CPU cycles.  As well,
            it's difficult to ensure that every place an error code is returned is checked.  Also, checking error codes results
            in error handling code distributed to every place an error code is visible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use Exceptions.  When an error is detected we create and throw an exception.  That causes, in C++,
            the destruction of every successfully constructed object in the enclosing try block.  Each try block has
            a chain of catch clauses.  If one of them matches the type of the exception instance its code is executed
            to start the recovery process.
            <spacer-15></spacer-15>
            Note that a thrown exception interupts the expected execution flow and destroys possibly all the
            important state computed in the try scope up to the point where the exception occurred.  That means
            that recovery has to reinitialize the destroyed objects and somehow recover their state.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Error handling usually entails using error codes in the few places where processing can't proceed in the
        presence of errors - we can't open a file or connect to an endpoint.  Otherwise we design the placement
        of try blocks and think carefully about their catch clauses and how we can use them to recover.
        This is a fundamental part of program design and is harder to retrofit after an implementation is nearly complete than
        to make error handling a part of the early design process.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        To design error handling we start by making a catalog of all the errors that could happen:
        <ul class="tight">
          <li>
            User inputs: command line arguments, entries in web pages or application interfaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            File and directory handling: do they exist, are they locked by another program, are our
            security credentials insufficient for access.
          </li>
          <li>
            Connecting to remote endpoints: are they not currently available, do we have incorrect urls?
          </li>
          <li>
            Devices and services we use may have errors or are not currently available.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        We then think about the actions the program needs to take, for each error, to recover.  We also plan
        notifications to the users so they understand what is happening to the computation.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        Whenever possible we attempt to continue processing in the presence of errors. For example,
        if we are processing a number of files an error accessing one of them should not stop us
        from processing the rest.
        <spacer-15></spacer-15>
        The best error handling is to avoid errors by design.  For example, we should never use absolute paths
        in our code.  Usually we will specify paths relative to the current directory.  That way our program
        can be successfully moved, along with its reference directories, to another machine that has a different directory structure than our
        development environment.  When that isn't possible we can use configuration files that our code reads
        on startup to establish key paths and files.  When we port the application to a different machine we
        simply edit the configuration to match its new environment.

      Each package contains a test stub main function for construction testing.  That is surrounded by
      compiler declarations #ifdef TEST_PACKAGE and #endif.  If we define for compilation the TEST_PACKAGE
      string, where PACKAGE is the name of the package, then the compiler will include the main and we can
      run the package in stand-alone mode.  If the string is not defined then the compiler's preprocessor
      does not include this code so we can combine the package with others to make a program.
