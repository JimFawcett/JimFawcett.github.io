      A colleague and former student, Mike Corley, works as a software developer and consultant in
      information technology.  He is interested in building a framework for managing machine learning
      processes for classification of large sets of documents.  Typically these processes include:
      <ul class="tight pad10">
        <li>
          Collection of sources of data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extracting objects from the sources for analysis and classification by one of several
          parsing applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          Applying one or more of a very large collection of analysis/classification algorithms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Converting the results into information for humans, e.g., extracting meta-data, removing
          redundant or inappropriate data items, forming summaries, gathering relationships between
          data items.
        </li>
        <li>
          Projecting results through context dependent viewers: analysis of the process, information
          stream for users, results summaries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Forwarding to long-term storage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Saving a unique record of the steps above to enable replication.
        </li>
      </ul>
      The management of these processes has traditionally been effected using Bash Shell text-based scripts
      or with custom Python programs. The results are often a proliferation of scripts and difficulty
      recreating or cloning a past process.

    <h3>Concept:</h3>
    <indent-block>
      Mike&apos;s goal is to build a framework for managing set-up and execution of specific instances
      of this process using PowerShell cmdlets linked in a pipeline architecture.  His intent is to create
      a single fixed framework with plug-in components to automate the process:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Support each of the process steps listed above by extracting plug-in components from a gallery,
          or creating a plug-in that, after proving its use in the current process, is registered with
          the gallery.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use interfaces and object factories for each processing stage to isolate framework mechanics
          from application specific processing.  That enables substitution of plug-ins.  So each plug-in is required to implement the interface
          and object factory for its processing stage: collection, parsing, cleaning, analyzing, viewing, ...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="pad10">
        Concept for Implementation:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Since the pipeline traffics in objects, PowerShell cmdlets are an effective mechanism for
          implementing pipeline stages.
        </li>
        <li>
          A PowerShell cmdlet is an instance of a .Net class that derives from
          System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet or its sister PSCmdlet.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a .Net class instance its methods send and receive objects, not just text streams.
          Its base Cmdlet class provides hooks to integrate it with the PowerShell execution enviroment.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h3>MLiPS Story</h3>
    <indent-block>
      <u>M</u>achine <u>L</u>earning <u>i</u>ntegrated with <u>P</u>ower<u>S</u>hell is about an interesting
      idea, developed by Mike Corley, for managing a complex process with many parts that change from
      application to application. This story summarizes the concept, and may, eventually, be extended to
      describe an implementation.
