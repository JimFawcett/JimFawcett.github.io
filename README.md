# JimFawcett.github.io

Documentation for Repositories published at https://JimFawcett.github.io

<strong>Goals:</strong>
Port many of the code samples and components from https://ecs.syr.edu/faculty/fawcett.  Some of them will
get new tests and added functionality.  There will also be new code projects that I develop after retiring
from Syracuse University, and there will be more focus on Linux code as well as Windows.

<strong>Status:</strong>
The site now has more than 40 repositories of mostly C++ code, all with documentation.  I've just started adding videos about the 
site content.  There are a lot of planned updates: https://JimFawcett.github.io/SitePlans.html.
