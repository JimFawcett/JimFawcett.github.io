    <h3>C++ Story:</h3>
    <!-- extracted content -->
    <a href="https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppStory_Prologue.html">Prologue</a>
    <div class="pageNote">
      This C++ Story pulls together site pages, presentations on C++ syntax and semantics, and example code
      to present a brief tutorial on the C++ programming language. Also
      provided are exercises to test your skills.
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      The story consists of 5 chapters on: basics of C++ syntax and semantics, classes, class relationships
      and their use to build compound objects, templates and template specialization.  The concluding chapter
      surveys repositories available on this site and provides additional links and references.
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      Below, find instructions on how to navigate through the story, using buttons on the right and/or
      key presses.

    <a href="https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppStory_Survey.html">Survey</a>
    <div class="pageNote">
      Chapter 1 focuses on C++ language syntax and semantics before classes. It discusses all the
      things C++ added to C, describes its type system, points to basic code examples to review,
      and ends with a discussion of C++ models for compilation, program execution, and use of memory.
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      Finally, there are a set of exercises for you to test your skills.  The exercises start out
      with simple requests with discussion about how you satisfy them.  Later exercises require some
      design on your part.

    <div class="pageNote">
      This page provides brief descriptions of the major C++ language features and a few of its
      many libraries.
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      It also describes a few libraries that I built for CSE687 - Object Oriented
      Design class work.
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      In the second half, it provides materials on threads, sockets, and how you
      can build Graphical User Interfaces for C++ code.

    <a href="https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppStory_Operations.html">Operations</a>
    <div class="pageNote">
      This page describes what C++ added to the C language, how they are similar, and where they are
      different.  It winds up discussing the core intent of the C++ language.
    </div>
    <spacer-10></spacer-10>
    <a href="https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppStory_Classes.html">Classes</a>
    <div class="pageNote">
      C++ is a relatively strongly typed language, favoring error detection at compile
      time over run-time.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      The fundamental (built-in) types are simple, similar to those of other languages like C# and Java.
      That&apos;s what this page presents, along with a few comments about weakly typed languages.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      We cover later some of the standard library types that are provided by the language environment
      but not by the language itself.
    </div>
    <spacer-10></spacer-10>
    <a href="https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppStory_Templates.html">Templates</a>
    <div class="pageNote">
      This page documents a repository for a number of basic code demonstrations.
      You will find demonstrations for
      syntax and semantics of the language excluding classes, in &quot;Basic Demos for C++ syntax&quot;.
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      The third group of demos, &quot;Basic Demos for C++ libraries&quot; will help you get started
      using streams and the STL containers.
    </div>

    <a href="https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppStory_Libraries.html">Libraries</a>
    <div class="pageNote">
      This page discusses models for compilation, program execution, and memory allocation.
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      The compilation model will help you understand how C++ compilers and linkers collaborate to build
      execution images.  The structure of C++ packages is driven by the way this build process works.
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      The execution model shows how your programs use stack memory and how it interacts with the windows
      console.
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      Life-times for the instances your program creates are determined by where they are placed in memory.
      The Memory model will help you understand how to control those life-times.
