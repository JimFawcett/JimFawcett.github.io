    <h3>C++ Story:</h3>
    <!-- extracted content -->
    <a href="https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppStory_Prologue.html">Prologue</a>
    <div class="pageNote">
      This C++ Story pulls together site pages, presentations on C++ syntax and semantics, and example code
      to present a brief tutorial on the C++ programming language. Also
      provided are exercises to test your skills.
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      The story consists of chapters on: basics of C++ syntax and semantics, classes, class relationships
      and their use to build compound objects, templates and template metaprogramming.  The story concludes
      with a description of a few of the standard libraries, libraries provided with this site, and a few
      third-party libraries.

    <a href="https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppStory_Models.html">Models</a>
    <div class="pageNote">
      Chapter 1 introduces models for building and executing C++ programs, for memory layout,
      classes, and templates.

    <a href="https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppStory_Survey.html">Survey</a>
    <div class="pageNote">
      Chapter 2 provides a gentle survey of the C++ language and its libraries.
      Each of the topics covered here are discussed in much more detail in subsequent chapters.
      <!--<spacer-10></spacer-10>
      Finally, there are a set of exercises for you to test your skills.  The exercises start out
      with simple requests with discussion about how you satisfy them.  Later exercises require some
      design on your part.-->

    <a href="https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppStory_Data.html">Data</a>
    <div class="pageNote">
    Chapter 3 - Data discusses Types, Explores their meaning and structure.  That is followed by a
    summary of modern casts.  Then, some new types added to the standard library are briefly discussed.
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    Data initialization is presented with examples followed by an example of structured binding. The 
    Chapter concludes with a discussion about assembling complex data structures using the STL
    containers as building blocks.
   </div>
    <spacer-10></spacer-10>
    <a href="https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppStory_Operations.html">Operations</a>
    <div class="pageNote">
      Chapter 4 - Operations is concerned with functions, methods, functors, and lambdas. It presents
      information about passing parameters and return values including a brief discussion of return value
      optimization.
      <spacer-10></spacer-10>
      The chapter concludes with a quick survey of the STL algorithms and Testing.
    </div>
    <spacer-10></spacer-10>
    <a href="https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppStory_Classes.html">Classes</a>
    <div class="pageNote">
      C++ is a relatively strongly typed language, favoring error detection at compile
      time over run-time.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      The fundamental (built-in) types are simple, similar to those of other languages like C# and Java.
      Those are augmented with a very effective set of library-defined types.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      Most of the chapter is devoted to the process of building user-defined types with classes and structs.
      Here, we emphasize the construction of value types. This is consolidated with a discussion of typical
      class anatomy for value types.
    </div>
    <spacer-10></spacer-10>
    <a href="https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppStory_ClassRelationships.html">Class Relships</a>
    <div class="pageNote">
      C++, like many object oriented languages, provides four fundamental class relationships:
      inheritance, composition, aggregation, and using.  To those C++ adds the friend relationship.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      The chapter focuses on compound objects, their memory layout, construction, and polymorphic operations
      within inheritance hierarchies. The chapter concludes with a couple of examples.
    </div>
    <spacer-10></spacer-10>
    <a href="https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppStory_Templates.html">Templates</a>
    <div class="pageNote">
      Templates are the C++ mechanism to provide generic processing.  Chapter 6. - Templates discusses
      template functions with overloading and template classes with specialization.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      A lot of the focus of this chapter is on overload resolution and template type deduction. Several
      examples are presented for each of these topics.
    </div>
    <spacer-10></spacer-10>
    <a href="https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppStory_TemplateMetaprog.html">TemplateMetaprog</a>
    <div class="pageNote">
      Implementing templates required C++ to develop a functional language used by the compiler to
      provide template functions and classes.  Template metaprogramming is concerned with writing
      code in that functional language to provide features that essentially extend the language in ways
      useful for creation of applications.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      A lot of this requires some significant skill and effort, but provides long-lasting rewards through
      reuse.

      each link category.
