    <h3>&#8734;DL Traceability of Derived Data Objects to Raw Data</h3>
    <indent-block>
      ∞𝐃𝐋 provides a simple mechanism for linking data objects to the sequences of data processing
      and analysis. Each DataObject may have a standard attribute SOURCE with contains a list of full
      IDL paths to addressable subranges of data used as a source for this (derived) data.
      Obviously, raw data objects are distinguished by the fact that they do not have source data objects.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      Following the SOURCE links, ∞𝐃𝐋 can build and visualize networks of data objects reflecting the
      sequential process of stepwise data reduction. Using a global IDL addressing mechanism,
      such networks can connect data across laboratory and institution boundaries.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      This provides a rather unique and exciting opportunity for an entirely new scientific publishing
      paradigm. Given the fact that all the data in ∞𝐃𝐋 is visualizable using ∞𝐃𝐋 Viewers, a toolbox
      can be built on top of ∞𝐃𝐋 framework providing the ability to link final reports to the visual
      representations of all steps of data acquisition, processing, and analysis, obviating the need
      of generating data representations specifically for the particular manuscript in a particular journal.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      Metaphorically speaking, “the data never leaves the house”. Any electronic publication in the world
      just uses data object links provided by ∞𝐃𝐋, which are converted by ∞𝐃𝐋 to 2D or 3D media objects
      on-demand.

    <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
    <indent-block>
      Perceiving the global research process as a massive production of digital data objects, which is a 
      necessary and objective process driving scientific breakthroughs and the progress of human society, 
      the current system of scientific knowledge management which relies heavily on highly selective 
      publications of data interpretations with severely reduced assess to the underlying data, especially 
      the raw data, is woefully inadequate. 
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      This system should not be replaced, but needs to be supported and augmented by a parallel and 
      independent system of data library exposing as many digital data objects as possible linked into 
      the context of global research process.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      The ∞𝐃𝐋 model described here offers a holistic, integrated approach to create a global data library 
      from bottom up. The general contract of ∞𝐃𝐋 is that that in exchange for customers’ willingness to 
      format or re-format the data objects in compliance with the ∞𝐃𝐋 format, the Infinite Data Library 
      will provide an unprecedented level of data integrity, interpretability, and ease of data sharing, 
      data mining, and data audit. 
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      This would be impossible without deliberately reducing the variety of elementary data formats, 
      but the foundational belief is that the limited set of archetypical formats is sufficient for 
      building structured data objects of any practical complexity, the same way as 26 characters are 
      sufficient to describe the complexity of human thought and feeling in English language.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      The author hopes to attract like-minded “concerned citizens” of the research community,
      data enthusiasts, and all kinds of talented people, to collaborate on the implementation of ∞𝐃𝐋.
