    I&apos;ve had the good fortune, in twenty eight years teaching graduate courses at Syracuse University,
    to have great support from paid and voluteer Teaching Assistants.  They were smart, hard-working,
    and patient with students.  We often worked with about 200 students each semester, and the
    support I received was an essential part of our courses.  In gratitude, I&apos;ve taken my
    TAs to lunch each semester.  This photo is our last lunch at the SU Faculty Center before my retirement.
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    It has been a great pleasure for me to work with so many graduate students over the years.  I&apos;ve
    enjoyed almost every minute of the time I spent with them in the classroom and advising in my office
    and casual conversations in hallways.
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    This experience is a prime motivation for construction of this website.  I taught each of my
    courses primarily from materials in my <a href="https://ecs.syr.edu/faculty/fawcett">SU Website</a>.
    Some former students have contacted me saying that they still referred to the site for
    refreshers and pieces of code while working professionally.
    <spacer-25></spacer-25>
    So, I decided after retirement, to build this site to store and describe a curated selection of code and presentation
    pages originally developed for courses: Object Oriented Design, Software Modeling and Analysis, Design Patterns, Internet Programming,
    and Distributed Objects. Also to add new bits of code for other things that interest me.
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    Hosting on github makes code easily accessible, relatively easy to maintain, and I now have
    the opportunity to install only code that is currently relevant. My SU site had accumulated code
    over almost all of 28 years of teaching, so there was a lot of no longer relevant code there.
    Unfortunately my poor house-keeping skills applied to the SU site as well as my home.
    <spacer-10></spacer-10>
    This site provides a way to provide a more ordered and focused storage and try out some ideas for deployment.

    I wrote my first C++ program in 1988 and lot&apos;s of C and Fortran before that, and I am
    still enthusiastic about developing software.
    But retirement is more than coding.
    Now there&apos;s time for other things including friends and family and some travel - Cape Cod this summer.
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    So development of this site will go in sprints between other things. I expect, though,
    that the site will be fairly useful by the end of 2019.
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    I hope you find it worth your time.
    It would be great to hear from anyone using the site, especially former students.
