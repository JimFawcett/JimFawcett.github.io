  <h3>Initial Thoughts:</h3>
  While taking courses we usually have a "Required Course Text" that we study in detail to acquire specific bits of technology.
  The books I recommend here serve a different purpose; most discuss a philosophy of development or the foundations of a
  technology that we consume by reflecting on the material as well as practicing specific skills.
  <p />
  Developing skills with detailed study and practice is an essential beginning.  These books help us polish
  skills into professional expertise.  I think it is a really good idea to pick one concept book each summer to read and digest,
  especially if its topics are outside your normal sphere of work and thought.
  <p />
  While I worked in industry we would form a group of a half dozen or so people with a common interest, pick a good book, and
  digest it over a a couple of months of lunch-time discussions.  Each of us would take a chapter, digest it, and present to the
  others.  That way we all came away with a working knowledge of an area with relatively little effort and a lot of enjoyment.
  <p />
  Anyway, here's my list of books that will profitably take you out of your comfort zones, listed roughly in order of effort
  required, with the quickest first.

        <li>
          <strong>Why Read?</strong><br />
          If you want to know the foundations on which the .Net environment is built, this is an excellent place to acquire that knowledge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Required Time:</strong><br />
          A Summer of evenings if you've already taken CSE681 - Software Modeling and Analysis.

      <h3>Java Concurrency in Practice, Goetz, et. al., Addison-Wesley, 2006</h3>
      <ul class="tight">
        <li>
          <strong>Why Read?</strong><br />
          Discusses essential concurrency concepts in a clear, and very complete manner.  Much of the material is language agnostic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Required Time:</strong><br />
          A year of careful reading and experimenting, perhaps 8 hours per week.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Selected Topics:</strong><br />
          Benefits of threads, Risks of threads, What is thread safety?, Atomicity, Locking, Guarding state with locks, Liveness and performance,
          Visibility, Publication and escape, Thread confinement, Immutability, Safe publication,
          Designing a thread-safe class, Instance confinement, Delegating thread safety, Adding functionality to existing thread-safe classes,
          Documenting synchronization policies, Synchronized collections, Concurrent collections, Blocking queues, Blocking and interruptable methods,
          Synchronizers, Building an efficient, scalable result cache,
          Executing tasks in threads, The executor framework, Finding exploitable parallelism, Task cancellation, Stopping a thread-based service,
          Handling abnormal thread termination, JVM shutdown,
          Implicit couplings between tasks and execution policies, Sizing thread pools, Configuring ThreadPoolExecutor, Parallelizing recursive algorithms,
          Why are GUIs single-threaded?, Short-running tasks, Long-running tasks, Shared data mode3ls, Other forms of single-threaded systems,
          Deadlock, Avoiding and diagnosing deadlocks, Other liveness hazards,
          Thinking about performance, Amdahl's law, Costs introduced by threads, Reducing lock contention,
          Testing for correctness, Testing for performance, Avoiding performance testing pitfalls, Complementary testing approaches.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Note:</strong><br />
          There obviously is a lot of material here - more than you can digest in one Summer.  A sensible approach would take one quarter of the book
          each season and work on lots of probing examples as you go.

      <h3>Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach, Third Edition, Russell and Novig, Prentice Hall, 2010</h3>
      <ul class="tight">
        <li>
          <strong>Why Read?</strong><br />
          Artificial Intelligence technology has been evolving for a long time, has had some significant successes and frustrations.  It appears
          that AI will play an increasing role in the development of systems in many areas and is likely to be important over the span of your
          careers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Required Time:</strong><br />
          A Summer and Fall of careful reading and testing ideas, perhaps 8 hours per week.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Topics:</strong><br />
          Introduction, Intelligent agents, Solving problems by searching, Beyond classical search, Adversarial search, Constraint satisfaction,
          Logical agents, First-order logic, Inference in first-order logic, Classical planning, Planning and acting in the real world,
          Knowledge representation, Quantifying uncertainty, Probabilistic reasoning, Probabilistic reasoning over time, Making simple decisions,
          Making complex decisions, Learning from examples, Knowledge in learning, Learning probabilistic models, Reinforcement learning,
          Natural language processing, Natural language for communication, Perception, Robotics, Conclusions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Note:</strong><br />
          You aren't going to master AI in a summer reading of this book.  But doing a lunch-time seminar using this text for a half year with
          enough participants to spread the load would be a really good idea.  The idea is to learn about the concepts and know where to look
          for more details when you need them.
