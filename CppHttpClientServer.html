    <h3>Contents:</h3>
    <indent-block>
      CppHttpClientServer is a &quot;getting started&quot; prototype for two components:
      an HttpClient and an HttpServer. The goal is to make these as small and simple as practical
      so they can be easily used in distributed applications.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      The HttpServer is not intended to be a website server, but rather, an endpoint between
      two communicating applications, that use HTTP messaging.
    </indent-block>
    <h3>Current Design:</h3>
    <indent-block>
      The CppHttpServer uses a single threaded apartment model, e.g., it hosts a thread-safe
      blocking queue, which all CppHttpClients share.  I used that because I already had
      servers built with that model, so I just started with one of them.  However, that has
      serious performance implications.  The server should use a Multi-threaded apartment model
      because it uses a synchronous protocol.  The client waits for a reply.  That will keep other
      clients waiting until the server finishes all the other enqueued tasks.
    </indent-block>
    <h3>Status:</h3>
    <indent-block>
      The CppHttpServer will serve static pages to Chrome and FireFox, but has serious performance
      issues with multiple clients.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      Once this site has matured enough to be useful, I will start working on a Multi-Threaded apartment
      for CppHttpServer. I think this will eventually be a very useful facility.
      <spacer-15></spacer-15>
      If C++ eventually standardizes on a networking library (probably something like Boost::Asio),
      I will probably use that for the core implementaion code, wrapped by a Comm class with Sender
      and Receiver.
