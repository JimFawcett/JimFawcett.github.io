    <h3>Str String Class</h3>
    The Str class represents null terminated strings.  I wrote the code for this class before there was a
    std::string class.  You should, of course, use the std::string class.  However, Str is a really nice
    tool to illustrate how value types are created.
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    Value types are instances of classes that can be copied and assigned.  When a copy or assignment operation
    completes, there are two unique instances of STR, each with the same state values.  But these states are
    independent.  Should the destination of a copy or assignment change its state, that does not affect, in any
    way the state of the source Str instance.
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    This is achieved by careful implementation of copy, move, and assignment operations. Each of the items,
    below, shows how to implement every one of the Str class methods and a couple of global functions associated
    with the class, e.g., Str insertion and extraction operators.
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    For each method in the Str class, declared in Figure 1, we show, in the following items, how to declare,
    implement, and invoke the method.
    <h3>Str Methods</h3>
    <!--<details>
      <summary>Str Class Diagram</summary>
      <div id="fig1"></div>
    </details>-->
    <details>
      <summary><span>Str Default Constructor</span></summary>
      <div id="fig2"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      Str default constructor initializes an instance of Str with no arguments.  This might be used, for example,
      to construct an array of Str instances.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Str Copy Constructor</summary>
      <div id="fig3"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      Copy constructors play an important role in developing value types, since copying is an essential feature
      for them. Every time we pass a method or function argument by value, we make a copy of the instance on the
      functions stack frame.  The same is true for return by value, and any code that explicitly invokes a copy.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Str Move Constructor</summary>
      <div id="fig4"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      Move constructors allow the compiler to avoid making copies when the source of the copy is a temporary
      instance. A properly designed move constructor will take ownership of the temporary&apos;s state, possibly
      invalidating the temporary object.  That is not a problem as long as a move is the last thing that happens
      before the temporary goes out of scope.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Str Promotion Constructor</summary>
      <div id="fig5"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      Promotion constructors take a single argument of some other type, causing a conversion of the source type
      to the destination type. Essentially the promotion constructor is just using information contained in the
      source to build a new Str instance. For STR, we define a promotion from literal strings to Str instances.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Str Destructor</summary>
      <div id="fig6"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      Every class must have a destructor, either defined by the class, or implemented by the compiler.  For STR
      instances, that just deallocates their character storage from the native heap.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Str Copy Assignment Operator</summary>
      <div id="fig7"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      Copy assignment changes the state of an existing instance to match the state of a source instance.
      After copy assignment no changes have been made to the source.  The states of the two instances,
      source and destination, have the same values but are stored independently.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Str Move Assignment Operator</summary>
      <div id="fig8"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      The idea of move assignment is very like move construction.  The only significant difference is that
      with move construction we are building a new instance, while with move assignment we transfer ownership
      of the source&apos;s state to the destination.  When compiling an assignment expression, the compiler
      will use copy assignment if the source is a named object that will remain in scope.  If the source is
      a temporary object, the compiler will use move assignment.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Str Index Operator</summary>
      <div id="fig9"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      An index operator is used to access one item of a collection, usually stored as a private member
      of the class.  For non-const indexers, the index operator can be used to both read and write the item.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Str Const Index Operator</summary>
      <div id="fig10"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      A const index operator is used to access one item of a collection for reading, usually stored as a private member
      of the class. This allows indexing a const instance of a class that provides this operator.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Str Append a Character</summary>
      <div id="fig11"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      The character append operation is a bit complicated, because the Str instance may, or may not, have unallocated
      memory to store the character in its char array.  We have to check the space available and based on the result
      either store in the original array, or create a larger temporary array, copy the original characters, append the
      new one, deallocate the original array, and attach the new one to the instance.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Str Append a String</summary>
      <div id="fig12"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      This operation is very similar to the preceeding one, but now we check for space for the string.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Str Addition Operator</summary>
      <div id="fig13"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      Having implemented the Append operations, implementation of the Addion operator is almost trivial.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Str Cast Operator</summary>
      <div id="fig14"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      Casts create an instance of a new type based on information stored in the source type.
      For Str instances that simply returns a const pointer to its internal character storage,
      e.g., it returns a const literal string.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Str Insertion Operator</summary>
      <div id="fig15"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      Insertion operators have to be implemented as global functions.  For STR, the insertion simply
      streams its characters to the output stream, specified in its calling parameters.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Str Extraction Operator</summary>
      <div id="fig16"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      Extraction could be complicated because we are streaming in from a source for which we have no
      size information.  However, because we already implemented the character append operation, which
      takes care of ensuring adequate storage, we simply append characters from the source stream.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Coersions</summary>
      <div id="fig17"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      Coercions happen when a compiler applies a promotion constructor or cast operator to
      create an instance of a different type than the source of the coercion.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Binary Operator Model</summary>
      <div id="fig18"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      Binary operators can be defined either as class members or global functions.  This item
      discusses the syntax for doing that.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <details>
      <summary>Expression Model</summary>
      <div id="fig19"></div>
    </details>
    <indent-block style="margin-left:20px;">
      When the compiler scans a C++ expression it looks for type mismatches.  If it finds any, it
      will try to find a cast or promotion operation to resolve the mismatch.  If it finds one
      non-ambiguous way to resolve the types, it applies that way, otherwise compilation fails.
    </indent-block>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    This design is fairly large and, in a few places, a bit complicated. However, the result is that
    we can use instances of Str to represent strings, just as if they were of a type defined
    by the C++ language.  We can copy them, assign them, index them, ..., without participating in
    the instance&apos;s resource management.
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    The result is that the designer had to spend a lot of time getting all the details defined
    correctly, but users simply using the class without having any knowledge about its design
    other than its class interface.
