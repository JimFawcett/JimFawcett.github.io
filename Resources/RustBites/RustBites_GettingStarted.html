      Rust is an interesting language that is similar to C++ with the same performance potential,
      but also incorporates some unique clever ideas that allow it to make guarantees, by construction, about freedom 
      from memory handling defects and race conditions.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      Rust open-source development has been supported by Mozilla for years.  
      But recently major corporations like Amazon
      and Facebook have been hiring Rust developers to work full time on development of the Rust compiler
      and ecosystem.  They believe that Rust will be an essential part of their development process.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      The references in Table 1. are great places to get a quick tast of Rust and find out what it is all about.
      Most won&apos;t take too much of your time - an hour or so for each.

          These are <strong>excellent</strong> resources for understanding Rust&apos;s ownership model.  The
          videos use simple metaphors to help you understand the most important of the Rust models.

      Once you have the basic ideas it&apos;s time to start looking at language details and building some code.
      Items in Table 2. will help you do that.  These references take a bigger committment of your time.

            Rust Story is a narrative description of Rust.  It is fairly complete and has a lot of code examples.

          Rust Bites often have more details than the Rust Story
          and some of the Bites are used as common sources of information used in several other places in our
          presentation of Rust.

    <t-b>
      Reading through the Rust Story on a background thread while you work on BuildOn using the Rust Bites
      seems like a good strategy to me.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      BuildOn orders the implementation of the project&apos;s packages to start with a small knowledge base for 
      Rust.  Each succeeding package will require more understanding of Rust, and has references to help you get
      that.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      By the time you&apos;re done with the project you will have a base to keep learning on your own, as you
      have to do when learning any language.  As always, Dr. Google and StackOverflow are your friends.
