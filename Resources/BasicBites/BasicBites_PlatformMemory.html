    <h2>BasicBites - Platform Memory</h2>
    <t-b>
      Programs that run on a modern operating system are given a view into platfrom memory that appears to be
      linear, but in fact is not.  The operating system needs to support multiple concurrent users and a large
      number of active programs, often requiring much more than the available random access memory (RAM).

          Figure 1. Virtual Memory Structure

    <t-b>
      It does that by using blocks for memory contents that can be swapped out to a Page Table, implemented as a 
      memory-mapped file, and to other memory-mapped files holding control and contents for Disk Files and other Devices.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      Figure 1. shows a structure for memory-mapping.  There is a Virtual Address Space provided as a view into memory
      for each running program.  Program binaries are broken into 512 or 1024 sized blocks and loaded into physical
      memory and the page table, based on availability of physical memory.  When a process starts, its binary code is
      mapped into physical memory on an available memory page basis.  Any blocks that have no available space are mapped
      into the page table.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      Two processes may share the same block of physical RAM in order to share its contents.  That must be protected
      from writers clashing with readers by using system-wide synchronization constructs like named mutexes.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      As new processes start, the OS may map some of the pages of a running process into the page table, allowing a
      newly created process to use them for its binary.  Each OS has its own algorithms for deciding when a block of
      physical RAM should have its contents written to the page file and when it should be swapped back in.  This
      swapping process is also used for large files and devices.  
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      The event of initiating a page swap is called a page fault.
      A page fault will occur, for example, when code in an active page attempts to reference a page that has been
      swapped out to the page table.
      The rate of page faults has a significant impact on process performance.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      Page mapping is supported by a symbiosis of OS and hardware processing.
    </t-b>
    <h3>Consequences:</h3>
    <t-b>
      The good: virtual memory systems accomodate many users and many platform processes that should be loaded and become
      active when an individual logs in, if a needed process is not already running.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      The bad: when a program binary is very large it is much more likely to be subject to page faults when the OS
      needs to give memory to other programs.  Page fault processing takes a significant amount of time compared to program
      processing and may cause very large decreases in program performance.
