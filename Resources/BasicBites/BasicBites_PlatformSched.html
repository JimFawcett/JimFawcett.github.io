    <h2>BasicBites - Work Scheduling</h2>
    <t-b>
      Modern processors have several cores, perhaps two or four.  Code in each core can create and manage seperate 
      threads of execution.  When a process starts, its processing is assigned to a core, and is loaded with
      a single main thread running.  The code of that program can create additional threads to work on
      some partition of the program&apos;s activities.

          Figure 1. Windows Thread Scheduling
      </span>
    </photosizer-block>
    <t-b>
      Windows schedules threads, not processes.  A process is simply a container for resources shared by all the threads
      running in that process.  Figure 1. illustrates that: each thread has an associated Thread Context Block (TCB) and each
      TCB holds a pointer to a shared Process Context Block (PCB) that keeps track of the process resources.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      When a thread is created it has an assigned priority.  Its TCB is placed in a &quot;ready to run&quot; queue of TCBs with the same priority.
      Windows supports seven priorities, three of which are shown in Figure 1.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      The Windows scheduler uses a preemptive First Come, First Served strategy.  It starts a new thread by going to the highest 
      priority queue with one or more TCBs, dequeues the
      TCB at the end and creates a thread using the TCB contents.  The thread is assigned a quantum or time-slice that 
      determines the maximum time it can run before being suspended.  The quanta value is determined by its thread&apos;s
      priority - higher priorities get larger quanta, and so, run longer.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      A lower priority queue gets serviced only if all higher priority queues are empty.  For that reason, it is entirely
      possible, though unlikely, that a low priority thread never runs.  Windows is not a &quot;Fair&quot; operating system.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      When a running thread&apos;s time-slice expires it is placed at the end of the queue for its priority and waits for
      service by the scheduler.  There are three other reasons for a thread to stop: it may block waiting for a resource
      held by another thread, e.g. an IO device or file, it may be suspended by another thread making a call to suspend it
      using the thread API, or it may abort due to an unhandled exception.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      When a blocked thread becomes unblocked, as signaled by the resource on which it waits, it is placed back on the
      queue for its priority and waits to be serviced.  When a suspended thread is released by another thread, it too is
      placed on its ready to run queue.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      Linux and MacOS use essentially the same strategies with some amendments.  Lunix, for example maintains two stacks of
      prioritized queues: active and expired.  These schedulers behave in a manner similar to Windows, but schedule
      processes instead of threads.  Unlike Windows, Linux threads are simply child processes that share the same virtual address space
      as their parent process.
    </t-b>
    <h3>Consequences:</h3>
    <t-b>
      The good: Windows thread average processing rates depend on a, possibly program defined, priority.  Each core works most often
      on the most important threads.  Blocked or suspended threads use almost no processor resources.  Each thread has access to a
      set of shared process resources.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      The bad: low priority threads may never run.  A high priority thread may be blocked waiting for a resource held by a lower
      priority thread. Each thread has start-up latency that depends on its priority and the number of threads ahead of it in
      its ready to run queue and the number of waiting threads with higher priority. A fraction of a core&apos;s execution is
      spent on thread context switching.  If a large number of threads are running on a core, its average useful work performed may
      become very low.
