    <h2>BasicBites - Program Static Data Types</h2>
    <t-b>
      "In programming languages, a type system is a logical system comprising a set of rules that 
      assigns a property called a type to the various constructs of a computer program, such as variables, 
      expressions, functions or modules." - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">Wikipedia</a>
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      In this page we discuss static data types to illustrate some key differences between native and
      managed code.  A static data type declaration defines, at compile-time, a set of rules for creating,
      mutating, and disposing of a typed data instance.  Each instance has a fixed type throughout its lifetime
      [We will not be concerned here with type coersions like cast operations].
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      In the following sections we define type categories: <strong>Copy</strong>, <strong>Move</strong>, 
      and <strong>Reference</strong> that have distinct
      operations for setting the value of one instance based on the value held by another instance.  Common
      languages like C++, Rust, C#, and Java, implement these operations in different ways, discussed below.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      So, there are three parts to this discussion:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Part 1. Defines abstract type behaviors Copy, Move, and Reference.
        </li>
        <li>
          Part 2. Compares native and managed code environments from a type perspective.
        </li>
        <li>
          Part 3. Shows how C++, Rust, and C# implement the abstract type behaviors in their own type systems.
          <div style="height:0.75rem;"></div>
          A description for Java would use almost the same text as used for C#, as C# started out with a fork
          of the Java JVM, the same type structure with some language syntax changes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </t-b>
    <h3>Part 1. - Abstract Type Behaviors</h3>
    <h4>Copy Types:</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <t-b>
        Copy types are modeled after primitive language types like integers and floats.  When instances are
        copy constructed or copy assigned, their values are copied to new locations with new names and can be
        independently mutated.  For types occupying one contiguous block of memory this is implemented with
        a memcopy.
        <div class="indent pad10">
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td class="textsnip">Copy&nbsp;construction:</td>
              <td class="codesnip">T&nbsp;t1&nbsp;=&nbsp;2;</td>
              <td class="codesnip lightgray">T&nbsp;t2&nbsp;=&nbsp;t1;</td>

              <td class="codesnip lightgray">t2 = t3;</td>
              <td class="textsnip">t2 and t3 occupy disjoint blocks of memory with the same value</td>

    </div>
    <h4>Move Types:</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <t-b>
        Move types efficiently transfer ownership of instance resources from the original named instance to another.  
        The original becomes
        invalid and the new instance takes ownership of the resources of the original without moving them in memory.  
        We have moved the resources from one instance to another efficiently. This is
        often implemented by giving the new owner the address of the resource.
        <div class="indent pad10">
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td class="textsnip">Move construction:</td>
              <td class="codesnip">T t1 = new T(1, "xyz")</td>
              <td class="codesnip lightgray">T t2 = t1;</td>
              <td class="textsnip">t1&apos;s resources given to t2, t1 now invalid</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="textsnip">Move assignment:</td>
              <td class="codesnip">T&nbsp;t3&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;T(2,&nbsp;"abc");</td>
              <td class="codesnip lightgray">t2&nbsp;=&nbsp;t3;</td>
              <td class="textsnip">t3&apos;s resources given to t2, t3 now invalid</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </div>
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Move types often provide a clone() method that gives the destination a copy of the source&apos;s
        resources so the source remains valid.  
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Move operations usually only copy a pointer and so are
        fast.  Clone operations require copying all of the resources into a new instance and may be
        slow if the resources are large.

    <h4>Reference Types:</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <t-b>
        Reference types are handle-body pairs.  The handle resides in a local scope and body in the program&apos;s
        heap.
        Program code manipulates the handle to effect changes to
        the body&apos;s value.

      <t-b>
        Reference types require either reference counting or garbage collection to avoid double deletion or
        memory leaks.  
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Reference counting is fast and deterministic, but reference cycles will cause
        memory leads unless some form of mark and remove is used.  
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Garbage collection is non-deterministic
        and must devote processing resources to track pointers.

    <h4>Native Types</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <t-b>
        Native programs compile to platform instructions running in the process created for their executable.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        C++ and Rust both compile to native code.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Native data types are:
        <ul class="tight" style="margin-left:0rem;">
          <li>
            types with contiguous memory footprints:
            <div class="indent">
              primitive types, native arrays, and structs without pointer or reference members
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            types with non-contiguous memory footprints:
            <div class="indent">
              library and user-defined types.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            pointers and references to either of the above
          </li>
        </ul>
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        These types reside in the stack frame where they are declared.  Each type may compose instances of 
        other native types and aggregations of native instances on the native heap, as shown in Figure 1.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Compositions of native types place the composed instances within the memory footprint of the composing
        instance.  Aggregations place handles to the aggregated instance in the memory footprint of the
        aggregator and places the instances themselves in the native heap.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Native types provide code that returns owned resources to the platform when they go out of scope.
        this is an efficient deterministic destruction process.

      </t-b>
    </div>
    <h4>Managed Types</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <t-b>
        Managed programs compile to byte code and run in a virtual machine (VM) hosted by the process created for them.
        At load time the VM compiles byte code to native code by function or assembly. The compiled code is cached and
        not compiled again.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        C# and Java are managed languages - there are many others based on the Java VM.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Managed code has three kinds of data types: value types, managed reference types, and managed handles:
        <ul class="tight" style="margin-left:0rem;">
          <li>
            Value types
            <div class="indent">
              primitives, native arrays, and structs<br />
              implement Copy type behavior described in Part 1
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Managed reference types
            <div class="indent">
              all user-defined types<br />
              implement Reference type behavior of Part 1.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Managed handles (references)
            <div class="indent">
              support access and resource management
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        All managed reference types reside in the managed heap.  They may compose instances of value types
        that reside in the composers memory footprint.  They may also aggregate instances of reference types.
        That results in a composed handle to an aggregated instance in the managed heap.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        The resources of managed reference types are not managed by the instance; instead are managed by a
        garbage collector that is part of the heaps management process.  When a managed reference instance
        goes out of scope its resources are queued for disposal by the garbage collector.  That is a 
        non-determinstic process that requires processing to track active references.
      </t-b>
    </div>
    <h4>Consequences:</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <t-b>
        Native code handles resource management in an elegant efficient way, often referred to as &quot;Resource
        Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII).  Use of native pointers and references open opportunities for 
        undefined behavior.  The Rust language has an interesting way to avoid this deficit, see below.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Managed code requires placement of all user-defined types on the managed heap, accessed through handles.
        This avoids problems with undefined behavior at the expense of processing required to manage instances
        and latencies associated with compiling byte code to native code at run time.
      </t-b>
    </div>
    <h3>Part 3. - Language Specific Details</h3>
    <h4>C++ Specific Types</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <t-b>
        C++ programs compile to native code. 
      </t-b>
      <h4>Copy Types</h4>
      <t-b>
        In the C++ programming language all primitives and any user defined type that has valid copy constructor
        and valid copy assignment are Copy types.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        The copy operations and destructor are compiler generated if all the user type data members have correct 
        copy semantics.  Otherwise, the developer is obligated to provide definitions for them.
      </t-b>
      <h4>Move Types</h4>
      <t-b>
        C++ user types that define move constructor and move assignment behave like Move types when the source
        is a temporary or is preceded with a move declarator.  
        If copy constructor and copy assignment are correctly defined the type will act like a Copy or Move type
        depending on the context.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Unlike Rust, the C++ compiler does not disallow use of the invalid source after it is moved, which may result
        in undefined behavior.
      </t-b>
      <h4>Reference Types</h4>
      <t-b>
        C++ provides the primitives raw pointer, <span class="lightgray codesnip">T* ptr = *t;</span> and reference
        <span class="lightgray codesnip">T& ref = &amp;t;</span>
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        User types can take on reference behavior by using std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt; or std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;
        <div class="indent pad10 codesnip">
          auto r = std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;(new T(args));
        </div>
        The shared_ptr is reference counted, so lifetime of the instance ends when the last shared pointer
        instance goes out of scope.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        <details>
          <summary class="darkItem">User defined reference types</summary>
          <t-b>
            One could create a type with reference behavior by carefully crafting copy operations and destructor, but
            requires care to avoid memory leaks or double delete exceptions.  Not recommended.
          </t-b>
        </details>
      </t-b>
      <h4>Type Aliases</h4>
      <t-b>
        An alias is simply another name for a given type.  C++ provides two means of defining aliases:
        <ul class="tight" style="margin-left:0rem;">
          <li>
            <span class="lightgray codesnip">
              using ID = unsigned int;
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="lightgray codesnip">
              typedef unsigned int ID;
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </t-b>
      <h4>Consequences:</h4>
      <t-b>
        C++ has type abstractions that help build large but maintainable systems.  The language enables excellent
        run-time performance in the hands of experienced developers. And 
        there is a lot of accumulated experience and expertise for C++ development.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        The language rules allow possibility of undefined behavior and there are a lot of ways for that to happen.
        Rules the compiler enforces are not always obvious, especially for type inference, and may change depending
        on the program&apos;s context.
      </t-b>
    </div>
    <h4>Rust Specific Types</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <t-b>
        Rust programs compile to native code and run directly in the processes created for them.  
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        User defined types in Rust are structs, enums, or unions.  The struct plays essentially the same role 
        in Rust as classes do in C++, C#, and Java.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        The Rust compiler disallows mutation of an instance
        through a mutable reference whenever another reference to the same instance is active unless 
        the other reference is not used after mutation. This is a sufficient condition for safety, e.g.,
        prevents undefined behavior.
      </t-b>
      <h4>Copy Types</h4>
      <t-b>
        In the Rust programming language all types that implement the Copy trait are copy types. That includes
        all primitives and any user defined structs that have all copy members and are bounded by the Copy trait.
      </t-b>
      <h4>Move Types</h4>
      <t-b>
        Rust user defined structs that do not implement the Copy trait are Move types.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        The Rust compiler disallows use of instances that have been moved.  
      </t-b>
      <h4>Reference Types</h4>
      <t-b>
        Rust provides the primitives unsafe raw pointer, <span class="lightgray codesnip">let ptr:T* = *t;</span> and reference
        <span class="lightgray codesnip">let ref:&T = &t;</span>
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        The standard smart reference-counted pointers Rc&lt;T&gt; and Arc&lt;T&gt; 
        and smart heap pointer <span class="lightgray codesnip">Box&lt;T&gt;</span> are the only stdlib reference 
        types in Rust.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        When any of them are initialized from an instance in the stack, the instance is copied to the heap.
        <div class="indent pad10" style="width:max-content;">
          <span class="lightgray codesnip">let t = T:new(); let boxed = Box::new(t);</span>
        </div>
        boxed is a smart pointer to a copy of t in the heap.
      </t-b>
      <details>
        <summary class="darkItem">User defined reference types</summary>
        <t-b>
          A user defined reference type could be constructed with a struct using unsafe implementation blocks and
          lifetime annotations; but users of that type will find it hard to craft compilable syntax.
        </t-b>
      </details>
      <h4>Type Aliases</h4>
      <t-b>
        An alias is simply another name for a given type.  Rust provides two means of defining aliases:
        <ul class="tight" style="margin-left:0rem;">
          <li>
            <span class="lightgray codesnip">
              type ID = u32;
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="lightgray codesnip">
              use u32 as ID;
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </t-b>
      <h4>Consequences:</h4>
      <t-b>
        Rust has essentially all of the advantages of the C++ language.  In addition the compiler applies 
        safety rules that
        eliminate undefined behavior.  
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Rust has applied some smart ideas for its type system to achieve that.
        Also, the way Rust defines its Copy and Move types eliminates many of the boiler plate functions
        required for some C++ types.  It also removes most of the implicit type conversions supported by
        C++, resulting in much simpler type inferencing.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        The compiler&apos;s safety rules are sufficient, but not necessary - to have both is not feasible. So,
        for example, new
        strategies are required to implement components that are linked, like lists and graphs.  Essentially,
        we can use Vector indexing instead of references to extablish linked relationships.  Experience
        indicates that anything that can be implemented in C++ can also be implemented in Rust without
        resorting to unsafe blocks.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        It is more difficult to compile successfully in Rust, compared to C++, but once programs compile
        they are very likely to work, needing only fixes to program design logic.  There are no more
        long sessions looking for the source of pointer bugs.  In fairness, C++ now has many library types
        like smart pointers that help write bug free code.
      </t-b>
    </div>
    <h4>C# Specific Types:</h4>
    <div class="indent">
      <t-b>
        C# programs compile to IL (byte code) and run in a virtual machine (CLR) hosted by the processes 
        created for them.  At load time the CLR compiles IL to native code by function or assembly.  The
        compiled code is cached and not compiled again.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        C# types have two categories:
        <ul class="tight" style="margin-left:-0.0rem;">
          <li>
            Value Types:
            <div class="indent pad5">
              primitive scalar types, struct and enum<br />
              All reside in the stack
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Reference Types:
            <div class="indent pad5">
              class, interface, array, and delegate<br />
              All reside on the managed heap
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        All value types reside in the stack; all reference types reside in the managed heap.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Java types are nearly isomorphic to C# types, e.g., they have the same behaviors.
      </t-b>
      <h4>Copy Types</h4>
      <t-b>
        All of the value types are Copy types with the exception of structs that have aggregated members, i.e.
        contain references to instances on the managed heap.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Structs have the layout shown in Figure 4.  Struct members are composed if, and only if, they are
        value types. All other members are aggregated.  If no member is aggreggated then the struct is Copy.
      </t-b>
      <h4>Move Types</h4>
      <t-b>
        C# has no Move types.
      </t-b>
      <h4>Reference Types</h4>
      <t-b>
        All C# reference types have the same behavior as the Reference Type, described in Part 1.
        All classes are reference types and their instances reside in the managed heap.
      </t-b>
      <h4>Type Aliases</h4>
      <t-b>
        An alias is simply another name for a given type.  C# provides:
        <ul class="tight" style="margin-left:0rem;">
          <li>
            <span class="lightgray codesnip">
              using Records = List&lt;Tuple&lt;int, string, int&gt;&gt;
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </t-b>
      <h4>Consequences:</h4>
      <t-b>
        C#, like Java, eliminates undefined behavior by disallowing use of pointers.  Instead it creates
        all user-defined instances in the managed heap, refers to them with managed handles, and returns
        instance resources with garbage collection.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        There are performance consequences for using a VM with garbage collection.  Programs suffer initial
        latencies due to translation, at load time, of byte code into platform native code.  Garbage collection
        uses non-trivial processing to track managed pointers, and destruction is non-deterministic, so
        a designer cannot rely on immediate release of shared resources like files and sockets for other code to use.
      </t-b>
      <t-b>
        Compiling C# is usually fast and relatively easy.  And developers have fewer implementation bugs to
        chase after compilation, as those most often result from attempting to use null references.
