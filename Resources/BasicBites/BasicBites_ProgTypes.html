          "In programming languages, a type system is a logical system comprising a set of rules that
          assigns a property called a type to the various constructs of a computer program, such as variables,
          expressions, functions or modules." - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">Wikipedia</a>
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          In this page we discuss static data types to illustrate some key differences between native and
          managed code.  A static data type declaration defines, at compile-time, a set of rules for creating,
          mutating, and disposing of a typed data instance.  Each instance has a fixed type throughout its lifetime
          [We will not be concerned here with type coersions like cast operations].
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          In the following sections we define type categories: <strong>Copy</strong>, <strong>Move</strong>,
          and <strong>Reference</strong> that have distinct
          operations for setting the value of one instance based on the value held by another instance.  Common
          languages like C++, Rust, C#, and Java, implement these operations in different ways, discussed below.
        </t-b>
        <t-b>
          So, there are two parts to this discussion:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Part 1. Defines abstract type behaviors Copy, Move, and Reference.
            </li>
            <li>
              Part 2. Shows how C++, Rust, and C# implement the abstract type behaviors in their own type systems.
              <div style="height:0.75rem;"></div>
              A description for Java would use almost the same text as used for C#, as C# started out with a fork
              of the Java JVM, the same type structure, with some language syntax changes.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <t-b>
            Copy types are modeled after primitive language types like integers and floats.  When instances are
            copy constructed or copy assigned, their values are copied to new locations with new names and can be
            independently mutated.  For types occupying one contiguous block of memory this is implemented with
            a memcopy.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            The C++ language provides copy constructor syntax that supports developer defined composite copy
            operations, as shown in Figure 1b.  Other languages support developer defined clone operations that
            have the same result.

        <div class="indent">
          <t-b>
            Move types efficiently transfer ownership of instance resources from the original named instance to another.
            The original becomes
            invalid and the new instance takes ownership of the resources of the original without moving them in memory.
            We have moved the ownership of resources from one instance to another efficiently. This is
            often implemented by giving the new owner the address of the resource.
            <div class="indent pad10">
              <table>
                <tr>
                  <td class="textsnip">Move construction:</td>

          <t-b>
            Move types often provide a clone() method that gives the destination a copy of the source&apos;s
            resources so the source remains valid.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            Move operations usually only copy a pointer and so are
            fast.  Clone operations require copying all of the resources into a new instance and may be
            slow if the resources are large.

        <h3>Part 2. - Language Specific Details</h3>
        <t-b>
          The Abstract types discussed in Part 1. represent fundamental programming operations:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Copy</strong> operation happens when we assign primitive instances in C++, Rust, and C#.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Move</strong> operation is an efficient transfer of ownership of instance resources. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reference</strong> operations copy handles that refer to instances in the heap.
            </li>
          </ul>
          In this part we will illustrate how each of the languages: C++, Rust, and C# implement or approximate the abstract types.
        </t-b>
        <div style="height:0.5em;"></div>
        <a id="c++"></a>
        <h4>C++ Specific Types</h4>
        <div class="indent">
          <t-b>
            C++ programs compile to native code.
          </t-b>
          <h4>Copy Types</h4>
          <t-b>
            In the C++ programming language all primitives and any user defined type that has valid copy constructor
            and valid copy assignment are Copy types.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            The copy operations and destructor are compiler generated if all the user type data members have correct
            copy semantics.  Otherwise, the developer is obligated to provide definitions for them.
          </t-b>
          <h4>Move Types</h4>
          <t-b>
            C++ user types that define move constructor and move assignment behave like Move types when the source
            is a temporary or is preceded with a move declarator.
            If copy constructor and copy assignment are correctly defined the type will act like a Copy or Move type
            depending on the context of its instances.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            Unlike Rust, the C++ compiler does not disallow use of the invalid source after it is moved, which may result
            in undefined behavior.
          </t-b>
          <h4>Reference Types</h4>
          <t-b>
            C++ does not directly support Reference types, but it has the primitives:
            <div class="indent pad10">
              raw pointer,
              <span class="lightgray codesnip">T* aptr = &t;</span> and reference
              <span class="lightgray codesnip">T& aref = t;</span>
            </div>
            The C++ reference is not a Reference type, as described in Part 1., but rather a type qualifier that
            creates a fixed
            binding to its target with a pointer, but uses object syntax to manipulate the target.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            The C++ std library provides std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;:
            <div class="indent pad10">
              <span class="codesnip codebg">auto r = std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;(new T(args));</span>
            </div>
            It provides a method <span class="codesnip inlinecodebg">move</span> that transfers ownership of
            the target to another <span class="codesnip">std::unique_ptr</span>.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            The std library also provides std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;, a reference counted smart pointer, so
            lifetime of the instance ends when the last shared pointer
            instance goes out of scope.  Another shared_ptr is added to the share through assignment:
            <div class="indent pad10">
              <span class="codesnip inlinecodebg">auto shareT1 = std::shared_ptr&lt;new(t)&gt;;</span><br />
              <span class="codesnip inlinecodebg">auto shareT2 = shareT1;</span>
            </div>
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            <details>
              <summary class="lightItem">User defined reference types</summary>
              <t-b>
                One could create a type with reference behavior by carefully crafting copy operations and destructor, but
                requires care to avoid memory leaks or double delete exceptions.  Not recommended.
              </t-b>
            </details>
          </t-b>
          <h4>Type Aliases</h4>
          <t-b>
            An alias is simply another name for a given type.  C++ provides two means of defining aliases:
            <ul class="tight" style="margin-left:2em;">
              <li>
                <span class="lightgray codesnip">
                  using ID = unsigned int;
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="lightgray codesnip">
                  typedef unsigned int ID;
                </span>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </t-b>
          <h4>Consequences:</h4>
          <t-b>
            C++ has type abstractions that help build large but maintainable systems.  The language enables excellent
            run-time performance in the hands of experienced developers. And
            there is a lot of accumulated experience and expertise for C++ development.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            The language rules allow possibility of undefined behavior and there are a lot of ways for that to happen.
            Rules the compiler enforces are not always obvious, especially for type inference, and may change depending
            on the program&apos;s context.
          </t-b>
        </div>
        <a id="rust"></a>
        <h4>Rust Specific Types</h4>
        <div class="indent">
          <t-b>
            Rust programs compile to native code and run directly in the processes created for them.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            User defined types in Rust are structs, enums, or unions.  The struct plays essentially the same role
            in Rust as classes do in C++, C#, and Java.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            The Rust compiler disallows mutation of an instance
            through a mutable reference whenever another reference to the same instance is active, unless
            the other reference is not used after mutation. This is a sufficient condition for safety, e.g.,
            prevents undefined behavior.
          </t-b>
          <h4>Copy Types</h4>
          <t-b>
            In the Rust programming language all types that implement the Copy trait are copy types. That includes
            all primitives and any user defined structs that have all copy members and are bounded by the Copy trait.
          </t-b>
          <h4>Move Types</h4>
          <t-b>
            Rust user defined structs that do not implement the Copy trait are Move types.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            The Rust compiler disallows use of instances that have been moved.
          </t-b>
          <h4>Reference Types</h4>
          <t-b>
            Rust does not provide Reference types but does support pointing to other instances.
            It provides the primitives unsafe raw pointer, <span class="lightgray codesnip">let aptr:T* = &t;</span> and reference,
            <span class="lightgray codesnip">let aref:T& = t;</span>.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            As with C++, the Rust reference is not a Reference type, as defined in Part 1.  Instead a Rust reference
            declaration forms a fixed binding to a target instance.  Its use is syntactically similar to the C++
            reference, but has much less freedom.  Its use is analyzed by the compiler to prevent undefined behavior
            due to dangling references.  If analysis results cannot ensure safety, the build fails.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            Standard smart reference-counted pointers Rc&lt;T&gt; and Arc&lt;T&gt;
            and smart heap pointer Box&lt;T&gt; provide means to point to and manipulate instances stored in the heap.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            When any of them are initialized from an instance in the stack, the instance is copied or moved to the heap.
            <div class="indent pad10" style="width:max-content;">
              <span class="lightgray codesnip">let t = T:new(); let boxed = Box::new(t);</span>
            </div>
            boxed is a smart pointer to a copy or move of t in the heap.
          </t-b>
          <details>
            <summary class="lightItem">User defined reference types</summary>
            <t-b>
              A user defined reference type could be constructed with a struct using unsafe implementation blocks and
              lifetime annotations; but users of that type will find it hard to craft compilable syntax.
            </t-b>
          </details>
          <h4>Type Aliases</h4>
          <t-b>
            An alias is simply another name for a given type.  Rust provides two means of defining aliases:
            <ul class="tight" style="margin-left:2em;">
              <li>
                <span class="lightgray codesnip">
                  type ID = u32;
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="lightgray codesnip">
                  use u32 as ID;
                </span>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </t-b>
          <h4>Consequences:</h4>
          <t-b>
            Rust has essentially all of the advantages of the C++ language.  In addition the compiler applies
            safety rules that
            eliminate undefined behavior, at the expense of longer compile times.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            Rust has applied some smart ideas for its type system to achieve that.
            Also, the way Rust defines its Copy and Move types eliminates many of the boiler plate functions
            required for some C++ types.  It also removes most of the implicit type conversions supported by
            C++, resulting in much simpler type inferencing.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            The compiler&apos;s safety rules are sufficient, but not necessary - to have both is not feasible. So,
            for example, new
            strategies are required to implement components that are linked, like lists and graphs.  Essentially,
            we can use Vector indexing instead of references to establish linked relationships.  Experience
            indicates that anything that can be implemented in C++ can also be implemented in Rust without
            resorting to unsafe blocks.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            It is more difficult to compile successfully in Rust, compared to C++, due to its safety checking.
            But once programs compile
            they are very likely to work, needing only fixes to program design logic.  There are no more
            long sessions looking for the sources of pointer bugs.  In fairness, C++ now has many library types
            like smart pointers that help write bug free code.
          </t-b>
        </div>
        <a id="c#"></a>
        <h4>C# Specific Types:</h4>
        <div class="indent">
          <t-b>
            C# programs compile to managed code, e.g., to IL (byte code) and run in a virtual machine (CLR) hosted
            by the processes
            created for them.  At load time the CLR compiles IL to native code by function or assembly.  The
            compiled code is cached and not compiled again.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            C# types have two categories:
            <ul class="tight" style="margin-left: 2em;">
              <li>
                Value Types:
                <div class="indent pad5">
                  primitive scalar types, struct and enum<br />
                  All reside in the stack
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                Reference Types:
                <div class="indent pad5">
                  class, interface, array, and delegate<br />
                  All reside on the managed heap
                </div>
              </li>
            </ul>
            All value types reside in the stack; all reference types reside in the managed heap.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            Java types are nearly isomorphic to C# types, e.g., they have the same behaviors.
          </t-b>
          <h4>Copy Types</h4>
          <t-b>
            All of the value types are Copy types with the exception of structs that have aggregated members, i.e.
            contain references to instances on the managed heap.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            Structs have the layout shown in Figure 4.  Struct members are composed if, and only if, they are
            value types. All other members are aggregated.  If no member is aggreggated then the struct is Copy.
          </t-b>
          <h4>Move Types</h4>
          <t-b>
            C# has no Move types.
          </t-b>
          <h4>Reference Types</h4>
          <t-b>
            All C# reference types have the same behavior as the Reference Type, described in Part 1.
            All classes are reference types and their instances reside in the managed heap.
          </t-b>
          <h4>Type Aliases</h4>
          <t-b>
            An alias is simply another name for a given type.  C# provides:
            <ul class="tight" style="margin-left: 2em;">
              <li>
                <span class="lightgray codesnip">
                  using Records = List&lt;Tuple&lt;int, string, int&gt;&gt;
                </span>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </t-b>
          <h4>Consequences:</h4>
          <t-b>
            C#, like Java, eliminates undefined behavior by disallowing use of pointers.  Instead it creates
            all user-defined instances in the managed heap, refers to them with managed handles, and returns
            instance resources with garbage collection.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            There are performance consequences for using a VM with garbage collection.  Programs suffer initial
            latencies due to translation, at load time, of byte code into platform native code.  Garbage collection
            uses non-trivial processing to track managed pointers, and destruction is non-deterministic, so
            a designer cannot rely on immediate release of shared resources like files and sockets for other code to use.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            Compiling C# is usually fast and relatively easy.  And developers have fewer implementation bugs to
            chase after compilation, as those most often result from attempting to use null references.
