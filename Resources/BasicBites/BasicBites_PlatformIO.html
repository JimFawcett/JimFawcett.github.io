    <h2>BasicBites - Platform I/O</h2>
    <t-b>
      I/O operations send or receive data using terminals, files, in-memory strings, sockets, Graphical User 
      Interfaces (GUIs), and devices like keyboards, mice, trackpads, and speakers.
      This involves one of two rather distinct types of processing: synchronous or asynchronous.  
      <ul>
        <li>
          Synchronous I/O uses functions that don&quot;t return until the operation completes.  
          Programming language libraries provide read and write functions for that purpose.      
        </li>
        <li>
          Asynchronous I/O uses functions that supply a call back function and return immediately.
          The callback is invoked when the operation completes.  
          Programming language libraries provide async read and async write functions for that purpose.      
        </li>
      </ul>
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      Synchronous operations interact with the platform API to translate to and from 
      an external environment.
      Asynchronous operations use either I/O completion ports or Windows messages to send and receive data, using
      the platform API.  API calls are routed to device drivers appropriate for a specified device.

    <h3>I/O Completion Ports</h3>
    <t-b>
      I/O completion ports provide a mechanism for processing multiple asynchronous I/O requests.  When sending
      a request the requesting thread returns without waiting for the I/O process to complete.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      Asynchronous read or write requests using library methods may use I/O completion ports internally. 
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      When an asynchronous I/O request is made, an I/O Request (IOR) object is created and sent to the completion
      port. The IOR holds a file handle for the specified destination and may also hold a callback reference.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      Each IOR enqueues an I/O Completion Package (IOCPkg) that gets serviced by a thread pool thread which is responsible 
      for sending the request to an appropriate
      device driver and await its completion.  If a callback is registered it will invoke the callback on completion.

            .Net provides a Task type that is used with async functions that invoke await and is 
            executed on the current synchronization context.  If that is a thread-pool
            context each task is run on a thread-pool thread.  If a non thread-pool synchronization context is used, then
            when the task blocks it is suspended, enqueued, and another task is dequeued by the same thread.
          </t-b>
          <t-b>
            I suspect that the Rust async await functionality works the same way.

    <h3>Windows Messaging</h3>
    <t-b>
      When external devices are used to send key presses, mouse movements, button clicks, ... each device event
      results in a device driver creating a message and enqueueing to a raw input queue.  
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      The Window manager
      dequeues each message and routes it to an appropriate window.  For example, a mouse button click gets
      routed to the first window which contains the mouse coordinates in its active area.  Keyboard key events
      by default are routed to the window in focus.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      Routing means that the Window manager enqueues a filtered version of the message to an appropriate window&apos;s
      message queue.  Each window has an event dispatcher that sends the message to an event handler for processing.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      Note that an application may send messages to a hidden window as a means of internal communication.
    </t-b>
    <h3 class="clear">Streams</h3>
    <t-b>
      Streams provide buffered I/O operations that collect data from possibly several requests and send that 
      data collection to a device driver as one operation.  Each basic read or write request needs to enter the platform kernel
      to access an appropriate device driver.  That takes a 
      significant amount of time compared to user mode processing.  Buffering reduces the number of calls into the
      platform kernel and so improves program throughput.
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      Essentially, streams collect a continuing sequence of event data and, based on an internal threshold,
      send on all of the data since the last operation as a single new operation.  This happens for both
      input and output streams, that is, data events external to the program - input - and data events generated
      by the program - output.
    </t-b>
    <h3 class="clear">Consequences</h3>
    <t-b>
      Each application has the option of sending and receiving either synchronous or asynchronous I/O:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Synchronous I/O requires the handling thread to block until completion so operations that may
          block for a long time, like network communications, will adversely affect program performance
          if handled on the main thread of execution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Asynchronous I/O allows the requesting thread to return immediately, but increases the overall
          processing load on machine&apos;s cores due to creation of I/O completion object and dispatching
          to thread pool threads.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      Each application has the option of using buffered or unbuffered I/O.  This is independent of the choice
      to use synchronous or asynchronous operations.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Unbuffered I/O sends each request to the kernel for processing by a device driver.  For infrequent
          requests this requires no addition processing at the expense of more (infrequent) system calls.
        </li>
        <li>
          Buffered I/O collects a series of I/O requests before entering the kernel, resulting in fewer
          expensive operations, but incurs the buffering overhead.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </t-b>
    <t-b>
      For most programs the choice of buffering and asynchrony may or may not improve performance and so
      should be tested before committing to production code.
