- ChatGPT-4 is a new language model created by OpenAI that can generate text that is similar to human speech.
- It advances the technology used by ChatGPT, which is currently based on GPT-3.5.
- GPT-4 can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy, thanks to its broader general knowledge and problem solving abilities.
- GPT-4 is more creative and collaborative than ever before. It can generate, edit, and iterate with users on creative and technical writing tasks, such as composing songs, writing screenplays, or learning a userâ€™s writing style.
- GPT-4 surpasses ChatGPT in its advanced reasoning capabilities. For example, it can explain the plot of Cinderella in a sentence where each word has to begin with the next letter in the alphabet from A to Z, without repeating any letters.
