**ChatGPT** and **ChatGPT Plus** are both conversational AI models developed by OpenAI. The primary difference between the two is that **ChatGPT Plus** is a more advanced version of **ChatGPT** that has been fine-tuned on a specific dataset to improve its accuracy and relevance ¹³. 

While **ChatGPT** uses a 12-layer transformer model with 117 million parameters, **ChatGPT Plus** uses a large 24-layer transformer model with 1.5 billion parameters ². This means that **ChatGPT Plus** requires more computational resources but can generate higher quality text and has a wider range of knowledge and understanding than **ChatGPT** ².

Another difference between the two models is that **ChatGPT Plus** provides insights based on recent events, which is a feature that **ChatGPT** does not have ¹³. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
