    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <!--<p>
    The acronym OCD stands for Operational Concept Document.  It's purpose is to make you think critically about the design
    and implementation of a project before committing to code.  It also serves to publish your concept to the development team,
    which for this course is you (and only you).  For this project we will be writing an Operational Concept Document for
    the remaining projects, e.g., Projects #2, #3, and #4.

    One focus area for this course is understanding how to structure and implement big software systems.  By big we mean systems
    that may consist of hundreds or even thousands of packages<sup>1</sup> and perhaps several million lines of code.
    We won't be building anything quite that large, but our projects may be considerably bigger than anything you've worked
    on before.
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    In order to successfully implement big systems we need to partition code into relatively small parts and thoroughly test
    each of the parts before inserting them into the software baseline<sup>2</sup>.  As new parts are added to the baseline and
    as we make changes to fix latent errors or performance problems we will re-run test sequences for those parts
    and, perhaps, for the entire baseline.  Managing that process efficiently requires effective tools for code analysis
    as well as testing.  How we do that code analysis is illustrated by the SMA projects for this year.  In OOD, we will focus, this year,
    on testing applications.
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    The projects this Fall build software testing tools in several phases.  We will emphasize C++ code
    but want our tools to be easily extendable to other similar languages like C# and Java.
    You will find it useful to look at the <a href="../../Webpages/BlogTesting.htm">SW Testing</a> blog for a brief introduction
    to production testing.

    In this first project we will build and test a small framework for single-user testing that:
    <spacer-10></spacer-10>
    <ul class="tight">
      <li>
        <strong>Defines a set of tests to run sequentially:</strong>
        <div class="indent">
          Each test is the combination of a test driver, that implements an ITest interface, and the production code it tests.
          We want to chain multiple tests to be executed in sequence.  We expect to save that sequence and add additional
          tests later, as the development of the code continues.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Provides exception-safe test execution:</strong>
        <div class="indent">
          Each test is to be run inside a try-catch block, used to handle exceptions thrown by the test.  A thrown exception
          does not stop testing of the sequence.  Instead, it results in a fail result for the test that threw the exception.
          Also, we want to insert each test into a single try-catch block so we don't have to litter our test drivers with
          a lot of exception handling.  We will discuss how to do that in class.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Supports logging test results:</strong>
        <div class="indent">
          The results of testing need to be reported to the person executing the tests.  We will do that with a Logger class
          that supports concurrently writing results into one or more output streams, e.g., to the console and a file or database for storage.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    <div class="clear"></div>
    Succeeding projects will build, progressively, on the work of the prior projects.

    <h3>Requirements:</h3>
    Your Single-User TestHarness Solution:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Shall</strong> use Visual Studio 2017 and its C++ Windows Console Projects, as provided in the ECS computer labs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shall</strong> use the standard streams libraries for all I/O and operators new and delete for memory management.
      </li>
      <li>
        (<strong>2</strong>) <strong>Shall</strong> provide an ITest interface that all tests must implement.
      </li>
      <li>
        (<strong>4</strong>) <strong>Shall</strong> provide a container that provides references to a sequence of one
        or more test instances.  
      </li>
      <li>
        (<strong>2</strong>) <strong>Shall</strong> provide a function that extracts callable test objects from the container
        and executes them within a single try-catch block.
      </li>
      <li>
        (<strong>1</strong>) <strong>Shall</strong> provide a logging facility that logs test success or failure, and test identification
        messages that provide information to the user during test execution.
      </li>
      <li>
        (<strong>1</strong>)
        The logger <strong>shall</strong> provide for writing a
        test message on the console, and into a file for persistant storage, with a single write<sup>3</sup> statement.
      </li>
      <li>
        (<strong>1</strong>) Each message <strong>shall</strong> provide information about the test, author, and time-date of execution.
        This information should be as compact as practical while still providing useful information.
      </li>
      <li>
        (<strong>4</strong>) <strong>Shall</strong> develop tests for each class in the <a href="../../Repository/cpp/Utilities/CodeUtilities">CodeUtilities</a> package,
        and execute them in your Single-User TestHarness.
      </li>
      <li>
        (<strong>4</strong>) <strong>Shall</strong> include an automated unit test suite that demonstrates that you meet all the functional
        requirements above.  Note that this is just a set of tests that is used to test the TestHarness
        packages.
      </li>
      <li>
        (<strong>1</strong>) Each test <strong>shall</strong> provide comments in the test driver code that cite what each part of the test
        does, and the expected results.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <ol style="font-size:small">
      <li>
        In C++, a package consists of two source code files, a header (.h) and an implementation (.cpp), that contain:
        <ul class="tight">
          <li>prologue, providing a name, brief descriptive phrase, author information, and environment information</li>
          <li>description of the package's responsiblities and required files</li>
          <li>maintenance history</li>
          <li>class declarations</li>
          <li>class method definitions</li>
          <li>a main function that implements construction tests for all the defined code</li>
        </ul>
        The <a href="CodeSnap-BlockingQueue.h.htm">Blocking Queue CodeSnap</a> is a good example.
      </li>
      <li>
        A software baseline is the set of all code considered to be part of the current system, excluding experimental code
        that individual developers are working on.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may name the writing method however you wish.  The intent is that there is some way of registering streams for output
        so that a write goes to every registered stream.
      </li>
