        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>
          The second project this Spring focuses on building software tools for code analysis.  We emphasize C++ code
          but want our tools to be easily extendable to other similar languages like C# and Java.
        </p>
        <p>
          Code analysis consists of extracting lexical content from source code files, analyzing the code's syntax from its lexical
          content, and building a Type Table (TT) or an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that hold the results of our analysis.  It is then fairly easy to build
          several backends that can do further analyses on the data held in TT or AST to construct code metrics,
          search for particular constructs, or some other interesting features of the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will find it useful to look at the <a href="../../Webpages/BlogParser.htm">Parsing</a> blog for a brief introduction
          to parsing and code analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this second project we will build and test a type-based dependency analyzer that uses the analysis machinery I developed
          for the CodeAnalyzer that the TAs and I run on your projects.
          You will add to the packages from the CodeAnalyzer, the new packages:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>TypeTable:</strong>
              <div class="indent">
                Provides a container class that stores type information needed for dependency analysis.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>TypeAnalysis:</strong>
              <div class="indent">
                Finds all the types and global functions defined in each of a collection of C++ source files.
                It does this by building rules to detect:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    type definitions - classes, structs, enums, typedefs, and aliases.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    global function definitions
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    global data definitions
                  </li>
                </ul>
                and capture their fully qualified names and the files where they are defined.  It uses the TypeTable
                package to store that information.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>DependencyAnalysis:</strong>
              <div class="indent">
                Finds, for each file in a specified file collection, all other files from the file collection on which they depend.
                File A depends on file B, if and only if, it uses the name of any type or global function or global data defined in file B.
                It might do that by calling a function or method of a type or by inheriting the type.  Note that this intentionally
                does not record dependencies of a file on files outside the file set, e.g., language and platform libraries.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Strong Components:</strong>
              <div class="indent">
                A strong component is the largest set of files that are all mutually dependent.  That is, all the files which can be reached
                from any other file in the set by following direct or transitive dependency links.  The term &quot;Strong Component&quot; comes
                from the theory of directed graphs.  There are a number of algorithms for finding strong components in graphs.  My favorite is
                the Tarjan Algorithm, nicely described here:
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan's_strongly_connected_components_algorithm">Tarjan Algorithm description and pseudo code</a>.
                You will need a graph class to implement this.  You will find one in the Repository:
                <a href="../../Repository/CppGraph">C++ graph class</a>.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Display:</strong>
              <div class="indent">
                Uses information in the Analyzer's AST and TypeTable to build an effective display of the dependency relationships between
                all files in the selected file set.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>NoSqlDb:</strong>
              <div class="indent">
                Stores and retrieves dependency information in a NoSqlDb&lt;std::string&gt;, you developed in Project #1.  Here, child relationships
                denote compile dependencies.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>TestExecutive:</strong>
              <div class="indent">
                Provides code to demonstrate that you meet all requirements.
              </div>
            </li>
          </ul>
          You will probably not need to change any of the code analyzer, other than to remove a few of its parts.  You will analyze dependencies
          based on types and global functions you find in the analyzer's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), then checking to see which files, if any, contain
          those tokens.
