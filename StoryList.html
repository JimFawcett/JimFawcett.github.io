    Note:
    <hr />
    StoryTeller appears to work correctly when run out of a website like github,
    e.g., an http:// or https:// protocol,
    where it uses localStorage and localStorage changed events.
    However, FireFox, Chrome, and Edge all have different semantics for localStorage
    when run from the file system, e.g., file://.  After a day of
    investigating, here&apos;s what I found:
    <ul class="tight pad10">
      <li>
        FireFox implements localStorage for both http: and file:, however, it does
        not propagate storageChanged events for file://.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chrome, for file://, sends storageChanged events, executes localStorage.setItem() and 
        localStorage.getItem(), but never actually writes anything to localStorage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Edge doesn&apos;t define localStorage for the file:/// protocol.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Most users will probably use StoryTeller from the site, so none of that matters.  However, 
    if you want to modify a story you have to run that from your local machine.

    If you just read StoryTeller.html from a local drive - after downloading 
    from <a href="https://github.com/JimFawcett/StoryTeller">https://github.com/JimFawcett/StoryTeller</a> - 
    that will only work with FireFox - I added some work-around code that appears to operate
    correctly.  I wasn&apos;t able to develop a work-around with a reasonable amount 
    of effort for Chrome and Edge.
    <spacer-15></spacer-15>
    Of course, you can set up a static website using node.js or Asp.Net Core and use any of those
    three browsers (the only ones I tested).
    <hr class="spread" />
    The current version of StoryTeller, hosted on https://JimFawcett.github.io, is logging some events
    to the console.  That is a significant performance hit, so I will only log until I&apos;ve tried
    to develop work-arounds for Chrome and Edge, or decided to leave StoryTeller as-is.
